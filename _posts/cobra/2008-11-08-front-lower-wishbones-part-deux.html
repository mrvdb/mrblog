<p>Last week I got the last two missing thrust washers for the front lower wishbones. Eager to do something I assembled the left side at the front. Should have been an easy job, but I had a hard time putting the inner thrust washers in, because the wishbone is a <em>'GD fit'</em>. Took me the best part of an hour which should have been a minute job.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The other wishbone is even worse, something which I <a href="http://cobra.mrblog.nl/2008/07/front-lower-wishbone-buildup.html">already noticed</a> when fitting the GD brackets to them. I think I'll have to construct some sort of temporary press to push the wishbone arms a bit apart to be able to fit the right side.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">On the other hand, pressing the water deflectors on to the uprights <strong>was</strong> an easy job, using the press.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">I'm running out of nordlock washers, so I'll order a few next week. Once I have them I can finish the whole front-end I guess. I had planned to do the rear-end first, but I think I'll <a href="http://andysgd427.blogspot.com/search/label/Front%20axle%20rear%20axle">create the same wheelbarrow</a> as Andy did.</p>
