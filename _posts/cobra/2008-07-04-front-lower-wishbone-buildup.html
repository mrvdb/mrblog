<p>Fitting the GD lower wishbone bracket to the wishbone seemed like a nice quick job. I layed out everything needed, took the obligatory picture ...</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span>and did a trial fit, only to find out the bracket would not fit. (both of them in fact). In the end I had to put the wishbones under the press and squeeze it a bit to be able to get the bolts in. Let's call it an '<em>engineering fit</em>'.</span></p>And the finished article:

<p>I probably should have painted the other holes which are not used; I did not realise it at the time.</p>
<p>Here's also a detail of the Nord-Lock washers I'm using. As a rule of thumb I'm adding around 20% to the specified torque numbers in the jaguar manual. With the nordlock-washers that should lead to about the same bolt tension.</p>
