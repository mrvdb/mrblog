<p style="text-align: left">Got one inner oil seal delivered today out of the two ordered, so decided to quickly press that in the rear hub waiting for it. Too quickly it turned out; I pressed it in while it was not lining up exactly with the opening apparently because it bent.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">So, out it came again and I'll have to order a new one. No progress made today :-(</p>
