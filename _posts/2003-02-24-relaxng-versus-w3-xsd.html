<p>xmlhack: Expressing mixed content in RELAX NG versus WXS [<a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1880">link</a>]</p>
<p>This is a nice reference. We are experimenting with expressing the blocklayout language in RNG, exactly because the XSD stuff is just plain unreadable. The <a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1714">RelaxMeter test for ambiguity</a> is especially interesting for checking a solution specified in RNG.</p>
