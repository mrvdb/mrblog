<p>Let's try to create a chain of documents like the one John did in <a href="http://wyome.com/index.php?module=articles&amp;func=display&amp;ptid=10&amp;aid=473">Xaraya 2.0 Brainstorming</a>. After a while the common denominators should float to the surface by looking at the whole chain.</p>
<p>I tend to view at an application development process like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>make it work</li>
  <li>make it right</li>
  <li>make it nice</li>
  <li>make if fast</li>
</ol>

<p>For Xaraya, the 1.0 release signals to me we've been able to make it work. Now, let's try to make it right. Some ideas on how follow.</p>
