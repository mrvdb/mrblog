I've had my eye on a
[[https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/][Yubikey]]  for a
while. This is a USB hardware crypto key used for signing, encryption
and one-time-passwords in many flexible ways.

Features:
- store private pgp keys on the hardware for authentication,
  encryption and signing;
- use a One-Time-Password functionality (helped by the yubico cloud
  for validation or your own validation server)
- Provide functionality over NFC
- configure 2 slots
