Experiences during ipv6 implementation on local network:
- providers lack quite a bit of knowledge, at least in the first line
  support, which means getting things checked or changed will take
  longer than usual;
- some devices just dont support ipv6, like printers and scanners
  which connect to the network or voip gateways
- because what you effectively do is create a second network on top of
  the existing one, everything gets complexer; making things ipv6 only
  is still out of the question, so be prepared to deal with extra work
- dns resolving will be slower, it may not be much but it will be
  slower because there must now be at least an attempt to check if the
  connection should use ipv4 or ipv6.
- computer support is mostly flawles, both windows, android, ios and
  linux work basically out of the box.
- the amount of addresses you get can get quite high:
  - if you use privacy extensions (windows, android and ios do by
    default) you already get at least 3 addresses for each interface
    (link local, the assigned prefix+mac address generated one and the
    one temporarily generated for you for privacy reasons)
  - more addresses come in for various reasons:
    - some devices create private networks of their own (the Nest
      thermostat for example)
    - the temporary addresses stay around in the output of ifconfig
      and ip addr for a while after they have expired.
- voip migration seems pretty difficult still, because the whole
  traffic bundle should exist on 1 protocol (either ipv4 or ipv6)
- the way addresses should be assigned has not converged yet, but
  dhcpv6 seems to be the loser in the game, that is it won't be used
  for address management as such, but many implementations (such as
  the one in openwrt firmware) also implement the router
  advertisements under the same name, so in a way the software is
  dhcpv6 = ra+dhcp
- having worked with ipv4 for so long is a threshold, because many
  things are just different; mostly better, but different
- There is a whole set of new problems which surface, which may or may
  not be my own incompetence, but nevertheless I ran into them:
  - if the ipv6 routing to the outside screws up, the local network
    suffers somehow, even though our config is as simple as it can
    get, this should not have happened
- the toolset for ipv6 is still messy and different per distribution
  (rdisc6 is ndisc6 on arch linux, the syntax for traceroute is
  different per distro etc.) Not a big problem, but confusing in the
  beginning.
