A review of the HHKB Professional 2 Type S keyboard

Points to deal with:
- look for regular reviews elsewhere
- getting used to the layout
- spacebar has other sound than other keys
- confusion about the USB hub, is the keyboard itself on the hub?
- price vs value hard to argue when forgotten the purchase
-
