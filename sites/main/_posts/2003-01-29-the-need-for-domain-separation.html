<p>In general, the temptation to bring the templating language close to the programming domain is high. It creates a possibility to do all things which the programming language can do as well, often powerfull and most of the time dangerous.
</p>
<p>In BL there is some PHP syntax hidden in the tags (for example the evaluation of conditions in if and while constructs).
</p>
<p>Here's a good example why the domain of the blocklayout templating system and the programming language in which it was implemented should be separated.
</p>
<p>Because the domain of blocklayout and PHP are so tight together now, this is just one example of what can happen.
