<p>
For play, i constructed a couple of templates on the <a href="http://xaraya.com">Xaraya</a> site to
connect the <a href="http://brainoff.com/worldkit">Worldkit</a> package to a xaraya installation to construct a
<a href="http://xaraya.com/worldmap">geographical map</a> (flash based) of the registered users on the Xaraya
site.
</p>

<p>
Worldkit uses an RSS feed with location information to construct an
image where the data points are shown on a map. In doing so, of course
the RSS feed can be subscribed to in the 'normal' way too, giving you
an addressbook directly in your aggregator of all people who have
provided their longitude and latitude information on the site.
