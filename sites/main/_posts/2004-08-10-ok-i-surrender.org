I decided to disable comments alltogether on this blog. The amount of
time required to manage the ip banning and deleting the spam comments
is getting too much in comparison with the small scale blogging i do
over here.

I just dont have the time to go to war on this and keep securing the
blog, while giving others the opportunity to comment on the
postings. My apologies to the serious commenters. Please use the
trackback facility to be able to refer to the postings which you want
to comment on.
