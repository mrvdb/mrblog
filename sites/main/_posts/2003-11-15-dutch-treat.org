Will the [[http://www.ebaygeeks.com/desktopmodules/ebaygeeks/ebay2rss.aspx][Ebay2RSS Feed]] help me to get the best prices on the expensive electronics i
would like to buy?


I hate shopping for lowest prices. Once i decide what i want to buy,
it must be available near me, with good service and i don't want to
wait.

Unfortunately my wishes do not correspond to the size of my wallet, so
to make them fit you dig and dig the internet to get good bargains for
stuff.

This used to take a lot of time. Being able to construct an RSS feed
from online auctions (eBay in this example) It should be a matter of
minutes to check whether there is an item in the search i want to bid
on, or not

My hopes aren't that high set, but i tried it out anyway. (Searching
for a digital SLR camera body below a $$1000,-)
