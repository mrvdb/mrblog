<p>Will the

</a> help me to get the best prices on the expensive electronics i
would like to buy?
</p>
<p>I hate shopping for lowest prices. Once i decide what i want to
buy, it must be available near me, with good service and i don't want
to wait.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately my wishes do not correspond to the size of my wallet,
so to make them fit you dig and dig the internet to get good bargains
for stuff.
</p>
<p>This used to take a lot of time. Being able to construct an RSS
feed from online auctions (eBay in this example) It should be a matter
of minutes to check whether there is an item in the search i want to
bid on, or not
</p>
<p>My hopes aren't that high set, but i tried it out
anyway. (Searching for a digital SLR camera body below a $1000,-)
