Microsoft Corp. has been granted a patent relating to the use of
buttons on hardware devices that form part of a user
interface. U.S. patent 6,727,830, granted April 27, is described as a
"time-based hardware button for application launch." The patent
abstract goes on to explain that the patent relates to how different
functions can be invoked depending on whether a button is clicked
once, clicked and held down for a period of time, or double-clicked
within a short period of time. [[http://maccentral.macworld.com][MacCentral]]
