#+title: Opportunity: apt-get like program on windows
#+tags: ideas

As more and more open source software runs well on windows (something
which has not always been that way to my great frustration), becomes
more cross platform (e.g. [[http://www.xchat.org][xchat]], [[http://www.sodipodi.com][sodipodi]], [[http://gaim.sourceforge.net][gaim]], [[http://www.openoffice.org][openoffice]] ), i found
myself needing an apt-get equivalent on windows.


Usually windows versions of OSS are either file archives to be dumped
into their install directory, or wrapped in a (big) windows
installer. I [[http://www.google.nl/search?q=apt-get+win32][searched]] for a windows version for apt-get, but got not
much to work with / from.

I wonder why, can't be that difficult. Shame i have no credit left on
my time account.
