Chris compares the two different mechanisms used for a concept
introduced in Team Foundation (TFS) known as Shelving. It is a concept
where you put a certain state of your development environment (
workspace, repository, whatever the local term is you are used to)
aside (on a shelf), work on some other stuff and take the shelved
state back into your workspace (UnShelve) when ready.

Let me add a few notes on how we do this in Xaraya with BitKeeper.
