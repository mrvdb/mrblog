</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
While it turns out that most people are idiots, the corollary to that
is sadly that you are one too, and that while we can all bask in the
secure knowledge that we're better than the average person (let's face
it, nobody ever believes that they're average or below-average), we
should also admit that we're not the sharpest knife around, and there
will be other people that are less of an idiot that you are.

<p>
Amen
