<p>Making xaraya react to the mt_keywords MT member was easy with the existing keywords module. The harder part (read: more time consuming) was to make the visual presentation of them in the site somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>If you view this article by itself (what we call the <strong>display</strong> view in Xaraya), you'll notice an extra part on the right side "Related entries" which lists other entries which have the same keywords attached to them. This allows a reader to quickly read all entries which have the same or similar taxonomy. <strike>The block isnt fully functional yet, because it reacts to some keywords while it doesn't for others, so there's still some digging to do there.</strike> (FIXED)</p>
<p>Outstanding task list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>making Xaraya react on the mt_tb_ping_urls member</li>

  <li>deal with the allow/disallow flags for trackback and comments</li>

  <li>find a home for mt_excerpt</li>

  <li>implement the mt.supportedTextFilters method to allow for markdown or textile input</li>
</ul>
