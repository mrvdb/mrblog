<p>Last week we started implementing a unit testing framework for Xaraya, which is highly integrated with the bitkeeper repository.
</p>
<p>As of now it allows you to register testsuites and testcases which can be run once or repeatedly with
</p>
<pre>
bk tests
</pre>
<p>I expected this to be an investment for the long run. The longer we used it, sometimes the tests would fail and we could fix things
<br />
more quickly. To my surprise the tests started failing basically right from the beginning, even when very premature code was available.
<br />
Both bugs in the testframework as in the codebase itself showed up immediately.
</p>
<p>I found that the crux to this is that having a test framework puts your mind in a
<em>different state
</em>. While developing you're trying to make things work, while writing tests you're trying to make things break. This combination has worked already in the early stages, i can hardly wait to see how this is going to work when the number of tests starts to grow and we actually use that information in our process.
</p>
<p>The scepsis has gone, unit testing rocks!
