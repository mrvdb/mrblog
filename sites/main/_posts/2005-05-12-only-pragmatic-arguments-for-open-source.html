<a href="http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1043">Computer Economics: research on strategic and financial management of
information systems</a> has results on a survey they held on why
organisations choose an Open Source solution.
</p>

<blockquote>
  "Computer Economics recently conducted a survey of visitors to its website regarding the perceived advantages in the use of open source software. Although not a scientific sample, the results are nevertheless startling"

From those results I largely miss 2 things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If "less dependence on vendor" is the main factor, i would like to
see some cases where that really mattered, not by showing people
who can't switch from MS (we know there is a lock-in there), but
by showing the ease of switching OSS providers.
</li>
<li>Apparently only the economical arguments count here. Which might
make sense considering the focus area of Computer Economics, but
what i would like to know if the argument of "freedom" or "right
thing to do" was asked, or mentioned at all.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Also, why these results are startling is beyond me.
