As a side-effect of <a href="http://mrblog.nl/2009/09/18/a-weeks-worth-of-claws-mail-on-osx.html">Migrating to Claws</a> I lost my OSX
addressbook usage, at least for mail. In my company we use
<a href="http://openerp.com">OpenERP</a> for CRM, invoicing and other business needs. This
means that the majority, if not all the email-addresses I need are in
our OpenERP database.
</p>

<p>
So, it made sense to finish an effort I started earlier, which is to
link OpenERP to our LDAP server and thus be able to query information
from the OpenERP database through an LDAP interface and have every
address available in the Claws addressbook (and the OSX addressbook
too for that matter).
</p>

<p>
In an earlier version of OpenERP we used a specific module for this,
which basically published an LDAP entry whenever we changed data in
the OpenERP database. This worked, but was a less than ideal solution,
not to mention it stopped working on an OpenERP upgrade. The solution
I wanted was to have the data available in LDAP immediately. This
meant making the LDAP server a "client" of the OpenERP database or,
said another way, making the OpenERP database function as an SQL
backend to the LDAP server.

<h3 id="sec-1">Defining an SQL backend for LDAP Creating an SQL backend for slapd</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1">
<p>
is, albeit terse, documented. I mainly used the information at
<a href="http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/978.html">theOpenLDAP FAQ</a>. The basic idea is that the LDAP-server connects
through ODBC to the database, the OpenERP database in our case, and
translates information found in relational tables to a subtree of the
LDAP hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
To model this information, you have to create at least 3 tables in the database:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>ldap_oc_mappings</code>: which objectClass of LDAP is stored in what
table;
</li>
<li><code>ldap_attr_mappings</code>: how attributeTypes of an objectClass are
resolved from RDBMS data;
</li>
<li><code>ldap_entries</code>: what's the DN of an entry, and how the entry relates
to its objectClass mapping and to its parent DN;
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The FAQ mentions two other tables, which we do not need. The idea is
to specify in these three tables how the LDAP server gets to the
entries and what they mean. For addressbook-like entries for mail, the
defacto objectClass to use for this is something referred to an
'inetOrgPerson'. The collection of these objects will be below an
objectClass 'organizationalUnit', giving the simplest 'tree-relation'
we can think of.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2">
<p>
The table <code>ldap_oc-mappings</code> is queried by the LDAP server to map these
object classes to tables, so the server knows in which tables to look
for the attributes of these two classes. The next two statements
insert two rows in that table, one for each object Class, mapping them
to the tables <code>ldap_inetOrgPerson</code> and <code>ldap_organizationalUnit</code>,
expecting a column <code>id</code> to contain the primary key for the objects.
</p>

{% highlight sql %}
    INSERT INTO ldap_oc_mappings(name,keytbl,keycol)
                VALUES('inetOrgPerson','ldap_inetOrgPerson','id');
    INSERT INTO ldap_oc_mappings(name,keytbl,keycol)
                VALUES('organizationalUnit','ldap_ organizationalUnit','id');
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The <code>ldap_inetOrgPerson</code> is actually a view over the <code>res_partner_address</code>
table in OpenERP, so it uses the data directly.
</p>

{% highlight sql %}
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ldap_inetorgperson AS
      SELECT
        a.id,
        btrim((COALESCE(a.firstname,'')||' ') || a.lastname) AS cn,
        btrim((COALESCE(a.firstname,'')||' ') || a.lastname) AS displayname,
        a.phone AS telephonenumber,
        a.lastname AS sn,
        a.firstname AS givenname,
        a.fax AS facsimiletelephonenumber,
        a.mobile,
        a.private_phone AS homephone,
        lower(a.email) AS mail,
        a.street,
        a.zip AS postalcode
      FROM res_partner_address a
      WHERE
        a.email  ''  AND
        a.email  '"' AND
        a.type  =  'contact';
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This gives a dataset of all people who actually have an email-address
registered in the OpenERP database. The column aliases are not needed
as such, but make the construction of the <code>ldap_attr_mappings</code> table a
bit easier. The second objectClass we registered in <code>ldap_oc_mappings</code>,
<code>organizationalUnit</code> can be modelled with one simple row in the table
<code>ldap_organizationalUnit</code>:
</p>

{% highlight sql %}
    INSERT INTO ldap_organizationalUnit(name) VALUES ('addressbook');
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
With that row, we basically define one organizational unit in our
simple tree named <code>addressbook</code> under which all our objects of type
<code>inetOrgPerson</code> will be placed.
</p>

<p>
So, at this point we have 2 objectClasses registered, we have created
the raw data for them. What's left? Two things, first, we need to
define how the attributes of the raw data relate to the object
attributes. For this, the table <code>ldap_attr_mappings</code> contains a row for
each attribute. For the <code>telephoneNumber</code> attribute, the data row is as
follows:
</p>

{% highlight sql %}
    INSERT INTO ldap_attr_mappings(
                        oc_map_id,name,sel_expr,from_tbls,join_where
                )
    VALUES(
                1,'telephoneNumber','telephoneNumber','ldap_inetOrgPerson','1=1'
        );
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This says basically to the ldap server that in order to get to the
<code>telephoneNumber</code> attribute for <code>inetOrgPerson</code> (<code>oc_map_id</code> 1 refers to the
first row in the <code>ldap_oc_mappings</code> table), it needs to look in the
table <code>ldap_inetOrgPerson</code>, use the same attribute name for the column
and apply no special where clause. It is basically a recipe for the
server to translate an LDAP request into an SQL query.
</p>

<p>
For each of the columns in the <code>ldap_inetOrgPerson</code> view, such a row
needs to be present in the <code>ldap_attr_mappings</code> table.
</p>

<p>
Still here? The final step is to create the third meta table
<code>ldap_entries</code>. This table is basically the lookup table to map
<span class="underline">ldap-index values</span> to <span class="underline">rdbms-index values</span>.  I have defined <code>ldap_entries</code>
as a view on the raw data as follows:
</p>

{% highlight sql %}
     CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ldap_entries AS
           SELECT
         0 AS id,
                 'ou=addressbook,dc=hsdev,dc=com' AS dn,
                 2 AS oc_map_id,
                 0 AS parent,
                 0 AS keyval
        UNION
       SELECT
                 ldap_inetorgperson.id,
                 ('cn=' || ldap_inetorgperson.cn) ||
                 ',ou=addressbook,dc=hsdev,dc=com' AS dn,
                 1 AS oc_map_id,
                 0 AS parent,
                 ldap_inetorgperson.id AS keyval
           FROM ldap_inetorgperson;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This does 2 things, it refers the ldap addres
<code>ou=addressbook,dc=hsdev,dc=com</code> as the organizational unit (<code>oc_map_id</code>
= 2) and assigns that ID 0. The second part of the UNION then formats
each of the inetOrgPerson addresses as an LDAP address in the
constructed tree (mine would be: <code>cn=Marcel van der
Boom,ou=addressbook,dc=hsdev,dc=com</code>) and maps it to the ID in the raw
data table (<code>keyval</code>) and puts the organizational unit as its parent.
</p>

<p>
With the above a minimal <span class="underline">proof of concept</span> can be constructed so that
each partner address which has an email-address shows up in
LDAP. After this, it's a matter of configuring the email-client using
the <code>ou=addressbook,dc=hsdev,dc=com</code> as a search base.
</p>

<p>
Here's a picture of my record in the claws address book:
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>


<p>
The same concept can be applied to other data in OpenERP (the partner
records themselves come to mind or user accounts). It would not be
that hard to wrap the above into an OpenERP module to manage
this. Once the LDAP server has a configuration to use an SQL backend,
all configuration can be done in OpenERP itself, modelling access
using the meta tables. Perhaps I'll do that at some point, if some of
my customers would benefit from this too.
