Let's try to create a chain of documents like the one John did in
 [[http://wyome.com/index.php?module=articles&amp;func=display&amp;ptid=10&amp;aid=473][Xaraya 2.0 Brainstorming]]. After a while the common denominators
 should float to the surface by looking at the whole chain.  I tend to
 view at an application development process like this:

 1. make it work
 2. make it right
 3. make it nice
 4. make if fast

For Xaraya, the 1.0 release signals to me we've been able to make it
work. Now, let's try to make it right. Some ideas on how follow.
