Today the BK-view module I wrote for Xaraya went into a live site
which can actually be used for something usefull.


The site http://bk.xaraya.com is the BitKeeper central for the
Xaraya project. The BK-view module is used to browse through all of
the clones used in the project, which is in the mean time a rather
large number, and I've only included the top level clones.


The clones from the clones are not even in there.
