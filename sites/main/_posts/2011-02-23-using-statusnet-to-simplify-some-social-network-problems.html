 <p>I'm probably not the typical user of social networks. I join them
   not for social reasons, i.e. interact with
   <i>friends
   </i>, but because i'm interested in the phenomena and the
   techniques involved. Many of
   <a href="http://o.mrblog.nl/mrb">my status updates
   </a> are about those techniques itself and probably not very
   interesting reading material for my friends, i.e. the ones I
   normally interact with socially. I bet most of them just ignore my
   updates. I have at times considered splitting my (online)
   personality into '
   <i>ich geek
   </i>' and '
   <i>ich normal
   </i>' (cfr. Schachnovelle, Stefan Zweig) and have the people I know
   follow the one or the other, but to date I haven't found a good way
   to deal with that.

   <h3>Register at them all?

     <p>Let's assume for the moment that I
       <b>am
       </b> interested in following my friends through social
       networks. Scribbling down a list of social networks I would
       have to join to be able to follow them:
     </p>
     <ol>
       <li>
	 <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter
	 </a> : most people I know are on there, but many are also on
	 there just because others are on there and not because it is
	 <b>their
	 </b>    primary network;
       </li>
       <li>
	 <a href="http://hyves.nl">Hyves
	 </a> : Big in the Netherlands only, but used by many of the
	 people I know as their primary network;
       </li>
       <li>
	 <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook
	 </a> : mostly my international contacts use Facebook, but
	 increasingly more dutch users are switching from hyves to
	 facebook;
       </li>
       <li>
	 <a href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca
	 </a> : the largest instance of the
	 <a href="http://status.net">StatusNet
	 </a>    software. Here's where most of my geek contacts are.
       </li>
     </ol>
   </div> Those four basically cover the usage of social networks by
   my friends. So, if I want to follow my (actual real life) friends I
   need to register myself on at least four networks. The actual act
   of registering isn't the problem, that's a one time thing. Checking
   in on a regular basis, (which is what the social part is all about
   no?), is the real problem. I don't want to spent time checking in
   at 4 different places. That'sthe first problem.
   <p> As a consequence of people using different networks, and
     therefore hindered in communication, several "
     <i>solutions
     </i>" have popped up. I quoted solutions because they are not
     really solutions in my view, but workarounds. All of these
     solutions involve some kind of mirroring updates on one network
     on the other, so a different audience has access to them. This
     can be done by the person himself by literally posting it to
     different networks (semi-automatically) or having one network
     <i>watch
     </i> the other (and vice-versa perhaps) and pull in updates when
     available. Apart from the fact that these mirror operations are
     not very reliable, the bigger issue is that there's duplication
     without reference. The status on the one network rarely accepts
     the one on the other as the original and thus the update is now
     in fact 2 unrelated updates. Especially in an area of short
     notices like status updates which are very abundant it's a big
     problem when from the start these messages get polluted and
     split.
   </p>
   <p> The third problem is that almost all of these social networks
   are owned and operated by single companies making you sign a
   lengthy user agreement you do not want to read nor fully comprehend
   if you did. This may not be a big issue for most, but it is a
   problem for me. It sounds unreasonable that I should surrender to
   unclear conditions if I am unable to avoid their service, for
     example by being able to choose my own provider or be one myself.
   </p>
   <p> So, impracticality, polution of status and unavoidability
     present my main 3 problems.
   </p>
 </div>
 <div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-3">
   <h3>Take control
   </h3>
   <div class="outline-text-3">
     <p>Despite the fact that there are quite a few initiatives to
     solve at least part of those problems (StatusNet aims at an open
     federated microblogging platform for example) these initiatives
     did not bring me any closer yet. In fact, so far they have moved
     me further away from a solution, because I had to introduce yet
       another social network to the list initially.
     </p>
     <p> I think there is no real solution to the problems yet. There
       are a couple of things I did though to make my life a bit easier.
     </p>
     <p> First, I chose my
       <i>entry point
       </i> to be an open system. For me this meant building my whole
       setup around a StatusNet instance, controlled by me and running
       on my own servers (
       <a href="http://o.mrblog.nl">http://o.mrblog.nl
       </a>).  This gives me connectivity and basically flawless
       federation with all statusnet sites. For both twitter and
       facebook there are bridges which make bidirectional
       comminication possible (not completely for facebook
       yet). Because StatusNet is open source and promotes Open
       Standards I can adjust my local install to my needs if
       needed. All the data relevant to my social graph is stored
       locally.
     </p>
     <p> Second, I've set up a bridge to Twitter. The StatusNet bridge
     is mostly working, it needs a kick in the butt about once a week,
     but other than that it happily transfers status updates back and
     forth. One change I made to it was to show the twitter status
     updates in the public timeline instead of just in the personal
       timeline. This makes it consistent with what StatusNet itself.
     </p>
     <p> Third, the bridge to facebook does not work fully yet and to
     be able to get status updates to facebook, you have to create an
     application on Facebook to pull out your status updates. So, my
     friends can hear me, but I can't hear them yet. I've worked
     around that by using gwibber which can merge (client side
       obviously) the two timelines into one.
     </p>
     <p> The above brings me a bit in the direction where I want to
     be, but the effort I've had to put in is way too much for this to
       be a scaleable solution.
     </p>

   <h3>What's still missing
   </h3>
   <div class="outline-text-3">
     <p>With my setup there are still quite a few annoyances:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>I can not subscribe directly to Twitter or Facebook users,
	 I still   have to visit their sites to click on 'Follow';
       </li>
       <li>There are minor annoyances in bridging my StatusNet updates
       (@mrb)   and my Twitter updates (@mrvdb) The bridge does not
	 translate the   two usernames properly into eachother (maybe a
       feature?)
       </li>
       <li>The facebook bridge is incomplete.
       </li>
       <li>Much better filtering, so I can filter out some notices
       from users   based on a regular expression of some sort. For
       example, check-in   notices from people I'm not that interested
	 in, so a filter would be   nice to at least suppress them in my
       stream.
       </li>
       <li>It takes time to keep the stuff running.
       </li>

   <h3>Bonus features
   </h3>
   <div class="outline-text">
     <p>By setting it up like I have I got a couple of bonus features:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>StatusNet supports a conversation view natively,
	 <a href="http://o.mrblog.nl/conversation/209001">Here's an
	   example
	 </a>   Note that the other person is from Twitter. Try to
	 find this view on   twitter itself, i have not been able to.
       </li>
       <li>I can do away with
	 <b>some
	 </b> feeds, because I can subscribe to them   directly using
	 StatusNet (using OStatus). Subscribing to   blogspot.com
	 blogs is an example.
       </li>
     </ul>
