Last Monday was my 40th birthday. I'm kind of used to having a quiet
birthday; most of the people are always on holidays during this time
of year. My girlfriend had organised a two day trip, she usually does
something like that for my birthday, to an unknown destination to do
something unknown. We were leaving on Sunday and returning on Monday
evening.
</p>

<p>
Sunday we went to an outdoor activity centre where we goofed around in
a Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB), got very muddy on a quad and very wet
on some jet-skis. Very good fun and indeed a perfect way to spent a
day for my birthday. A good diner-out and sleep-over in a hotel
completed the day. I thought it was perfect and I thought it was over…
</p>

<p>
However, the next day the GPS steered me towards the town centre of
<a href="http://www.utrecht.nl">Utrecht</a> where she got me an hour to play with one of these:

For those of you who do not recognise it; it's the <a href="http://www.segway.com/individual/models/i2-commuter.php">Segway i2</a> Personal
Transporter. A self-balancing two-wheel transportation device. It's
positioned somewhere in the gap between a bicycle and a pedestrian.
</p>

<p>
I've been mumbling about these things for a while now, but they cost a
small fortune (for a toy, which it would be, for me). On top of that,
their added value maximises in the city, and we live nowhere near a
city!  So, I can not defend a good reason to want one, other than that
this is the most natural way to control a motorised vehicle I have
ever driven. (or <b>glide</b>, what seems to be the segway term for
driving).
</p>

<p>
Renting one of these things does not help to cure this curiosity,
<b>au contraire!</b> Now I want one even more!
</p>

<p>
So, as of Monday I find myself thinking about formulating a consistent
argument for buying one. A new one costs around € 5000,= so that is
serious money.  I have actually done calculations how many kilometres
I would have to glide, replacing short trips in my car and saving gas,
to earn back the investment. (Quite a few, it turns out)
</p>

<p>
Would I travel by train more if I had one? The nearest train station
is like 10 kilometres from here, which is more or less doable; the
range of the segway is advertised as around 40 km on one battery
charge. I visit most of my clients by car (most of them are big and
are in industrial areas, not in cities), but I guess one out of four
trips could be replaced by the segway/train combination.
</p>

<p>
Would I take it with me if going to town by car? Most
definitely. Would we be going on city trips more? I guess, but we
would then have to buy 2 of them.
</p>

<p>
Would I be running the errands in our village with it? I think
so. What shops we have here are mostly at 4 to 5 km distance from our
home, so that is well within the Segway range.
</p>

<p>
The above sort of reasoning goes on for a while and at a certain point
I have convinced myself it is 'reasonable' to purchase it. At the very
least, there is a feeling of: 'Hey, I have worked hard to earn this
money, I have deserved this!' The reasoning has never failed, assuming
the enthusiasm of a product of service did not fade. (If they do, they
usually fade quickly for me).
</p>

<p>
It's not that I have regrets over previous toy purchases, but the
question remains: "Is there still a way to prevent me purchasing one"?
</p>

<p>
For the moment, I think I am going to construct a symbolic big saving
jar with the word 'SEGWAY' written on it.
