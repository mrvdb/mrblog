<p>So, perhaps a little status update is in order. Although I <a href="http://cobra.mrblog.nl/2007/12/declaring-garage-finished.html" title="Garage finished">declared the garaged finished earlier</a>, there's always something that needs to be finished/improved. So, this summer we place 2 new windows in the south wall.</p>

  With the help of <a href="http://www.rousse.nl" title="Peter Rousse klusbedrijf">Peter Rousse</a> new isolation was placed, and the wall was plated with Keralit panels.

<p>Although not a very big job, it always takes more time than originally planned. And yet again, I forgot to take a picture of the finished project!</p>
<p>Blogging wise, time was spent migrating from <a href="http://blogger.com" title="Blogger">Blogger.com</a> to a local <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="Wordpress ">Wordpress</a> installation. This allows me to use all the server stuff I already have in place in the office anyway and gives me a bit more control over the blog. I also got fed up with google analytics slowing the blog down even further than I do myself with all the pictures.</p>
<p>Wordpress also gives me a couple of extra options which would be harder to do at blogger:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/" title="iPhone theme for Wordpress">iphone specific theme</a>;</li>

  <li>support for pages and posts within my ecto blogging client;</li>

  <li>support for both categories and tags;</li>

  <li>more flexible uploads which I'll need shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to keep all URLs the same where possible. All feeds and links should still work as they did on Blogger. I had to sacrifice the <em>'Followers'</em> widget and the <em>'Profile details'</em> which are Blogger specific items. There's some work left to cater for Internet Explorer users (although they should use a better browser anyway).</p>
<p>Work on the cobra has been a bit slow, partly due to the above. All donor parts are basically done and waiting for me to put them on to the chassis. For the front-end I assemble the uprights, at first a bit baffled why the ball joints did not fit.</p>

  Took me a bit to realise there was still a part of the old ball joint attached to the upright which I apparently thought it was part of the upright. Other than that, quick job.
