<p>I dropped a quick message to Adriaan Tijsseling, the developer of the amazing <a title="Ecto blogging application" href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> package with a number of questions. One of the questions was whether Xaraya could be included as an endpoint in the accounts screen.</p>
<p>This morning, I fired up Ecto, and the update which contained it was already there! Man, this guy is quick.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>
