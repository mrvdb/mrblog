title: Using org2blog
---

Since moving from OSX to Linux, for reasons I will elaborate on in
another post, the only real thing which I missed was the MarsEdit
blogging application. The immediate effect is that both this blog and
my cobra blog have not seen any posts since the switch.

Initially I did make an effort to create a VirtualBox image for MacOSX
so I could potentially run OSX applications in my Ubuntu install, but
Apple made a pretty good effort to prevent me from running a
virtualized OSX, even if you have ticked all their boxes (read: spent
enough money on both their hardware and software). So, for the moment,
no OSX applications on my main machine anymore.

The next step was to decide on a new blogging solution, or perhaps
publishing solution, as a replacement for MarsEdit. My requirements were
as follows:
- emacs based solution, preferably integrated with
  org-mode;
- based on an api that wordpress supports;
- reasonably active project and responsive.

Finding a solution that satisfies all 3 of the above requirements
basically left me with org2blog. I did look at a couple of other
solutions but none of them met all 3 requirements, amazingly.

The use of org2blog is pretty simple, especially if you are already
using orgmode to publish documents. The gist of it is to start an
outline header and start writing the blog-post. Alternatively the
command ~M-x org2blog-new-entry~ can be used to start a blog-entry in a
new buffer (presumably to be saved to a file later on). Once finished
writing a =C-c d= keyboard shortcut publishes a buffer as a draft, where
=C-c p= publishes the buffer as a finalized post. (Posting as a page in
wordpress is also possible).

I'm using the /post-per-buffer variety/ for this post, so I can attach
the source for this posting at the end more easily. I also found that
working in a /one-posting-per-file/ matter is easier. (For starters, the
org2blog key shortcuts work properly).

The concept of org2blog is rather simple. It piggybacks on the
excellent export options already present in org-mode and exports the
relevant piece of text to html, takes that output and uses the
wordpress xml-rpc api to publish it.

This post contains a small set of examples which should be enough to
fullfill the vast majority of my blogging-needs. I need a way to chop
up text into paragraphs, marking some of my words with some inline
markup and I need a way to insert images in a variety of
ways. Additionally I want to be able to attach/link to files,
preferably automatically attached to the blog-posting.

So, let's have a look at the basic ingredients.

* Headers
Outline headers in org-mode (the lines that start with one or more
stars) are translated into html header elements.  Here is an example
of the first 5 levels of org-mode outline header levels:

* Header 1
** Header 2
*** Header 3
**** Header 4
***** Header 5

* Headers (cont'd)
The limitation/feature of org-mode that a paragraph belongs to the
immediate header above it is equally valid for the texts produced with
the help of org2blog. In this example, had I not put the /Header
(cont'd)/ header above this paragraph, the text would have belonged to
the /Header 5/ header.

With these, basic structuring of text is achieved. Within normal text,
inline markup like *bold*, /emphasized/, _underlined_, +striked through+, and
=monospace= and ~ver ba tim~ should work as well. (not sure what verbatim
should produce, but typically a multiple of spaces is the way to
distinguish it from normal monospaced paragraphs)

These two mechanisms should be enough to create readable blobs of
texts, but obviously I would like to have some means to make my posts
a bit more attractive; by including images.

* Images
Images in org-mode are basically references / links to image
locations. If such an image is a file on the local disk of the machine
I'm working on, I can insert a link to that file in the usual org-mode
way.

#+begin_src org
[[file:filename.png]]
#+end_src

Which results in this:

[[http://mrblog.nl/files/2010/10/blue.png]]

Users of org-mode may recognize this image as an example of the usage
of the ditaa system. Processing of /begin_src/ sections in the org file
will be done prior to publishing, so the image does not even need to
be linked explicitly, but can be an implicit result of code evaluation
like in the example below:

#+begin_example
\#+begin\_src ditaa :file filename.png :cmdline -r
+---------+
| cBLU    |
|         |
|    +----+
|    |cPNK|
|    |    |
+----+----+
\#+end\_src
#+end_example

#+begin_src ditaa :file blue2.png :cmdline -r
+---------+
| cBLU    |
|         |
|    +----+
|    |cPNK|
|    |    |
+----+----+
#+end_src

In this example the ditaa code evaluated delivered a file blue2.png
which was subsequently uploaded to the blog. (the problem here is that
mentioning the filename translates it into the url on the server, the
basename of the file is the local filename).

Using images which are already somewhere else on the web (I tend to
use flickr.com for these) inserting a link to their location should
suffice to get the image in the web page.

Example:

#+CAPTION: This text is the image caption.
#+ATTR_HTML: class="flickr" alt="external image example" title="Workbench"
[[http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4645566650_839553e399.jpg]]

So, with this basic knowledge I should be able to start publishing
again.
