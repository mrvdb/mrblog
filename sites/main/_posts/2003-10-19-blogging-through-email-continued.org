#+BEGIN_HTML
<p>Worked a bit on the&amp;nbsp;
<em>blog by email
</em> stuff. Sanitized the script a bit. The posting should now be a bit more clean as the backend now only includes stuff between the body tags of the received html. Nowhere near rock-solid, but useable nevertheless.
</p>
<p>Just for the technically inclined, this is the regexp used to extract the blog entry from the html:
</p>
<pre>
!&lt;body[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*?)&lt;/body&gt;!
</pre>
<p>Next step, getting some regular expression which makes sense to extract excerpt and extended entry (if any) out of there. Thinking about using &lt;hr /&gt; as a separator; it just looks natural when composing the entry. Dunno.
</p>
#+END_HTML
