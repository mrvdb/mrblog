<p>Last week i got myself a 17" Apple Powerbook. I've been wanting to check both hardware and OS X out for a long time. The combo of a Free BSD like core and the interface reputation of Apple seemed like an attractive combination.
</p>
<p>Not sure if it is yet, but so far I haven't been able to concentrate much on work ;-). Two things which stand out:
</p>
<ol>
<li>There is much more to play out there than is healthy for a person
</li>

<li>I completely underestimated the way you set your machine to your hands to work efficiently, i feel completely disabled using the new machine.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see if that changes over the next few weeks.
