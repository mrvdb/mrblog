Last week i got myself a 17" Apple Powerbook. I've been wanting to
check both hardware and OS X out for a long time. The combo of a Free
BSD like core and the interface reputation of Apple seemed like an
attractive combination.


Not sure if it is yet, but so far I haven't been able to concentrate
much on work ;-). Two things which stand out:
1. There is much more to play out there than is healthy for a person
2. I completely underestimated the way you set your machine to your
   hands to work efficiently, i feel completely disabled using the new
   machine.

Let's see if that changes over the next few weeks.
