Mind mapping seemed an attractive concept to bring some order into
my chaotic thoughts, so i spend an afternoon looking for a program
running on OSX to give it a spin.

The first thing I noticed all these programs assumed (with the
exception of [[http://thebrain.com][PersonalBrain]] which is not available on OS X) that my
thoughts are organized in a tree like manner. At some point someone
must have decided that a tree like organization for creative thinking
is appropriate.


*I am probably not a creative person*

The [[http://www.nova-mind.com/][leading]] mind mapping software on OS X does not even support quick
linking between one part of a tree and another part. Yes, you can draw
a line between two leaves, but that's not exactly what i had in mind.

The PersonalBrain mentioned above comes quite close to what i was
looking for, taking each idea as a possible starting point for
organizing. So, i played with it for an hour, deleting it from my PC
right after that. I managed to make a mess out of it
immediately. Instead of stimulating navigation and organizing thoughts
I found the program chaotic itself. It created links for me which i
didnt want with no obvious feedback when I did that. (and i got dizzy
from the UI too)


*There must be something wrong with my brain.*

If i understand all the involved techniques right, /i need a very graphically oriented and very fast RDF editor with lots of attention
to keyboard shortcuts and screen organization/, which hides the
horrendous details of RDF graphs and how they are specified. There are
some RDF editors out there, mostly java based, but they are exactly
that: <strong>RDF editors </strong>, nothing more, nothing less. Not
very imaginative about making RDF being a storage format for
semantical relationships and abstracting the interface around it.


*I must have misunderstood the semantics.*
