#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A group of Windows programmers is working on porting Gentoo's Portage
over to Windows SFU. If you don't know already, Windows Services for
UNIX is a full POSIX subsystem for Windows, enabling it to compile and
run almost any software that will compile on BSD, Solaris, HP/UX, and
Linux. Details to "emerge" soon.
