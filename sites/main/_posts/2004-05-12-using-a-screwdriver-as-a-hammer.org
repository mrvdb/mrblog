<p>Interesting discussion last night on Xaraya's IRC channel. I installed
<a href="http://colloquy.info">An amazingly good looking IRC client for OSX
</a>. This client has a feature called a
<em>buddy list
</em> which shows you the online status of people on IRC servers they are on regularly, much like the IM clients show an online status for people.
</p>
<p>The feature saves me visiting tens of irc servers just to find out that the person i need is not there.
</p>
<p>To be able to maintain this online status, colloquy sends /whois commands to the registered servers and channels to get the online status of the people in the buddy list. Obviously the sending of
<em>some
</em> command is necessary for this information.
</p>
<p>When i started adding people to the buddy list, one of the serverops asked me why i was sending him /whois commands every 30 seconds. At that time, i didnt know what was happening. A little investigating showed that it was the buddy list feature.
</p>
<p>In short, the discussion went fairly quickly into "user experience" versus "irc is not designed for this and stop doing this please". This is interesting for me, because usually i am on the side telling people the
<em>the system is not designed to do this
</em> while at this time i was in the
<em>end users chair
</em>
</p>
<p>There's no escape from this argument, the feature saves a lot of time, but is using a technique not intended for that particular goal. Who should give in? I dont know.
