<p>
Finally gotten around to integrating <a href="http://cobra.mrblog.nl">http://cobra.mrblog.nl</a> and this
site to the <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org">wordpress</a> installation. This site already
ran under wordpress—µ for while, but I wanted to wait for the
integration part until most of the 2.7 features appeared in the
subversion repository.
</p>

<p>
Creating this site (toplevel mrblog.nl) in the <code>wordpress—µ</code> application was easy,
content-wise. Adjusting the installation so I could register both
independent toplevel blogs (domains) and sites below that took a bit
of fiddling around, most of it related to getting the subdomains and
its users right.
</p>

<p>
Most of the conversion-work for the cobra blog involved installing the
plugins and making sure the users and admins were properly aligned.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the plugins used for the content I wanted the wordpress
feed plugin, so the toplevel blog can syndicate it's children. For
starters, this blog now syndicates all posts on the cobra blog, thus
fulfilling one of the steps i wanted to take with mrblog.nl (it being
the parent of *.mrblog.nl in a planet-like construction)
</p>

<p>
There are some smaller things which I want to correct (like the
toplevel syndication pinging back to the child, which is kinda silly)
but those can wait.
