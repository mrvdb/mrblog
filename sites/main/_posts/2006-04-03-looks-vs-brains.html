During their lives, people evolve, that's a given. For me, they start
out as little ugly creatures, which most of us seem to like for some
reason, and their brains don't seem to do very much either yet. (but
who knows, really?) So, low score in looks and brains.
</p>

<p>
The first 25 years seem to deal mostly with getting the "looks"
right. A minority succeeds. A substantially larger part of the
population &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; they have succeeded.
</p>

<p>
In the next 25 years the brains (should) get some more
attention. Possibly the earlier mentioned ratio of actual versus
perceived success is even worse here. If there is a third or even a
fourth quarter for people, looks are pretty much left behind, while in
some cases the brains still can produce some occasional surprise.
</p>

<p>
The above is an intro to what I was really wondering about: How does a
software package evolve with respect to "looks" and "brains" in its
life? (As always i'm mostly focussing on the typical open source
package and how that comes to be)
</p>

<p>
Being the person that I am, that brings roughly this image into my
head:
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Inevitably i tried to catch the question in some sort of
equation. Here's roughly the train of thought:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>as the analogy is a "natural" thing some sort of "natural
logarithmic" component came to mind
</li>
<li>work being mostly done in (large) groups which means that "things
inforce things" (bad or good) some exponential part should be in
there;
</li>
<li>it would be nice if we could have a simple number to characterize
the curve, like a quality factor Q or something.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the picture above the blue line would be the ideal(?) but rather
boring mix where the looks and brains are always completely in
balance. (The lifeline starts in the origin following the line with
age). The red line would be a "code-quality" oriented progression
where the green line focusses on looks. The rough idea is to get from
the origin to some point on the blue line as far away from the origin
as possible. By varying that Q factor that point can be placed
anywhere on the blue line. The formula i came up with was this:
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
which corresponds to the red line. (the green line is the reciprocal
where x and y switched places). The interesting part is to play with
the value of Q, look at the graph and reason about the software
product. Or vice versa, reason about <b>your</b> project and determine it's Q
factor.
