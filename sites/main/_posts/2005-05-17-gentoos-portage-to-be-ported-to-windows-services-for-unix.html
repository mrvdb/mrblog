<blockquote>
  <p>A group of Windows programmers is working on porting Gentoo's Portage over to Windows SFU. If you don't know already, Windows Services for UNIX is a full POSIX subsystem for Windows, enabling it to compile and run almost any software that will compile on BSD, Solaris, HP/UX, and Linux. Details to "emerge" soon.</p>
