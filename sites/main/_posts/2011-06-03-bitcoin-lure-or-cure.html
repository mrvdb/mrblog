<p> Many people got attracted to bitcoin the last couple of
months. This explosion of interest probably caused the monetary value
of bitcoins to show the same shape as the google trend-line chart
pictured below.
</p>
<p> In this article I will ignore the exponential increase in monetary
value since its inception and focus on some intrinsic properties of
bitcoin and why those are valuable as such.
</p>


<p> The sudden interest in bitcoin is not coincidental in my
opinion. The bitcoin
<i>ecosystem
</i> tries to solve a number of problems with the current systems of
trade, currencies and the economical structures in general we have in
place for them, like our national banks, the currency and stock
exchanges and the IMF. The last couple of years we have been
confronted, sometimes in very painful ways, with the shortcomings of
those systems and, not in the last place, the shortcomings of the
people involved; all of us.

<p> The financial crisis is obviously a complex issue and no single
cause can be determined. Whatever these causes are however, they have
provided a trigger for many to look for alternatives to create wealth
or, more important, create ways to hang on to wealth, especially if
there is not a lot of it to hang on to.
</p>
<p> For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you know how
bitcoins work. You will not have to be an expert in economics,
cryptography or computer programming, but a basic understanding of the
workings of bitcoin will be necessary. The websites
<a href="http://bitcoin.org">http://bitcoin.org
</a> en
<a href="http://weusecoins.com">http://weusecoins.com
</a> are good starting points.  Some of the points below won't make
sense if you do not have at least a rudimentary understanding of how
the system operates.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-1">The trust issue
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <p> Most people will worry (a lot) if they have money issues. This
    alone dictates that you absolutely want to trust all parties
    involved with handling your money.
    </p>
    <p> These parties include the people you receive money from, like
    your employer, the local banks you trust to keep your money safe
    for you, the government which monitors the usage of it, but also
    the 'coins' that represent the money. All of these need your
    continued trust, and that is a lot to ask. Especially if things do
  go wrong at times.
    </p>
    <p> Employers need your trust that they possess enough of the
    'stuff' to be able pay you for work, local banks need your trust
    so you let them keep your savings, governments and central banks
    need your trust that they won't screw up (by printing too much
    money for example) and the coins also need your trust that they
    are the real deal. All of the examples in some way betrayed our
    trust in the past. That has an effect on people. It may not be
    visible for a while, but broken trust
    <i>sticks
    </i>.
    </p>
    <div class="figure">

      </p>
    </div>
    <p> Bitcoin tries to address some of the trust issues people have;
    I think it was one of the main motivations for creating a system
    like bitcoin. It does this, amongst other things, by shifting a
    few of the trust items from people/institutions to verifiable
    technology.
    </p>
    <p> For example, instead of trusting a bank to verify transactions
    to be valid, because they are the only party who can oversee all
    transactions, trust is placed in hashing techniques to demonstrate
    that, for example, double spending is very, very unlikely. These
    techniques are easier verified and proven to be right than the
    bank which is now responsible for it, if only because we don't
    have access to these verifications. The major goal of both
    verifications is to prevent the same coin to be spent multiple
    times. (fraud)
    </p>
    <p> Another trust shift is the 'keep-save' mechanism. If you keep
    your savings on your savings-account at your bank, the combination
    of the banks trustworthiness and, should that fail, the (limited)
    guarantee the government gives on your savings makes that you can
    feel comfortable on parking your money there. With bitcoin, your
    trust will be in cryptographic tools and
    <i>the network
    </i> so you keep all your savings in a computer file. The
    mechanism you could use to keep it safe is to encrypt that file
    and spread it all over the network to many places to minimise the
    chances of losing all copies of it. There is no-one to trust but
    yourself, but there's also no-one which can protect you in case
    you screw up yourself.
    </p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-2">Distance is not important, value is
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <p> Another property of the bitcoin system, not unique to it but
    especially well implemented I think, is the way it makes the
    distance to receivers irrelevant and allows value to be put to use
    effectively. I'll give an example below.
    </p>
    <p> Say I want to transfer 2 euros to someone which is in a
    country far away from mine. The amount of time and money it takes
    to get this modest amount into the hands of that someone distant
    is ridiculous in the current financial system. My bank does
    provide a service but it will cost me at least 10 euros, double
    that amount if I want to get it done 'fast'. Fast, in this case
    meaning within 24 hours! For larger sums, the cost may be
    acceptable, but for small amounts both time and cost are
    ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p> There are many services which try to solve at least part of
    the problem outlined above. Services like paypal with on-line
    accounts to make things go faster, or proxy companies which gather
    up all the small amounts and transfer to the real supplier when
    things have piled up. Up until bitcoin I did not encounter a
    service which chose the simplest concept for this problem: "Set up
    a secure, verifiable, immediate non-refundable transaction between
    the involved parties."
    </p>
    <p> I do not believe the technology to do this has not been
    available to banks and/or credit card companies, so that can't be
    the reason they have not implemented a cheaper and more efficient
    system. It's not very hard to imagine what their reason is
    though. Distance used to be a major hurdle, it is not anymore.
    </p>
    <p> The key differences bitcoin provides here are:
    </p>
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>the receiver and sender communicate directly, trust is a lot
      easier to maintain if there are less parties involved. "No
      middle man needed, nor wanted"
      </li>
      <li>the 'act' of payment is almost immediate, the receiver can
      check almost immediately that a transaction has been
      made. (Verification for validity by the network can take a while
      though) In relation to the 24 hours described in the first
      paragraph this can certainly be considered very fast, near
      <i>real-time
      </i>
      </li>
      <li>a transaction fee is optional. If you specify one, you make
      it more attractive for others in the network to check your
      transaction and have a go at collecting that fee. If swift
      transaction handling is not important, but transferring, say
      0.05 euro, to a certain person
      <b>is
      </b> important, bitcoin is about the only way I know to do that
      effectively.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Remember, the amount of 0.05 euro may not be much to you and
    me, but there are parts in the world where it can buy you a meal
    or a bottle of water. The fact alone that bitcoin makes these
    kinds of transactions possible is enough reason to give it more
    than a casual look.
    </p>
    <p> Bitcoin increases the value of my â‚¬ 0.05 by allowing effective
use.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-3">No unreasonable control
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
    <p> It's probably true that bitcoin, or systems like it, scares
    financial companies and governments and therefore will have a
    rough time ahead. This scare is in part caused by a fear of
    decreasing control over the system compared to the
    <i>classic
    </i> system. Almost all economic commentators or government
    representatives will argue that 'some form of control' is needed
    to correct and stabilise the system. I'm not very convinced of
    that being effective or wanted anymore.
    </p>
    <p> Recently, the unreasonable control over money flow in the
    wikileaks dry-out attempt confirmed this once again for me. It
    doesn't really matter if companies like mastercard and paypal
    decide not to handle transactions for wikileaks themselves or that
    they have been put under pressure to do so. The fact that it
    happens shows they have control over where I spent my money. I
    don't want that. Bitcoin offers a system where this type of
    control is impossible by means of the system itself; personal
    threats will be effective I'm afraid with any system.
    </p>
    <p> Next to the self-control over spending purposes, anonymity is
    also important for some people. The example often used, mostly in
    critical pieces on bitcoin, are criminals. Bitcoin makes it
    possible, when used in certain ways, to bring money from A to B
    without exposing identities to each-other and to third
    parties. This is obviously attractive for criminals, including
    people who want to evade taxes.  This is a valid concern and
    should be addressed properly, but I don't think it has anything to
    do with bitcoin as such. With regard to
    <b>this
    </b> aspect, bitcoin has no other properties than cash, it's just
    more effective and easier to use than exchanging bits of paper
    money. The real use-case here is the non-criminal people who want
    to perform semi-anonymous transactions for valid reasons.
    </p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-4">So, what's the verdict?
  </h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p> Bitcoin is a good idea, generally speaking. From a technological
viewpoint it's excellent. It's trivial that libertarians and
anarchists will be attracted by bitcoins, we don't need to argue the
case for them. The challenge is to present the extra-, not the
replacement-, values of bitcoin for all the other people out there. I
have touched on three of the most important ones to me. There are more
properties which make it very attractive as an alternate choice for
exchanging value.

     alt="Verdict form" title="Verdict form"/>
  </p>
</div>
<p> Many 'digital cash' systems have been presented before bitcoin,
but for all of them I could point out critical weaknesses within a
very short time. For many of them this was not even a technical
weakness, but an organisational (like a paranoid initiator, looking
for patent protection) or an economical issue (creating a metal backed
currency in the hands of a private company). With bitcoin there are
certainly weaknesses in the system, but I have not been able to find a
critical one upfront.
</p>
<p> The goal of bitcoin is not necessarily to take over existing
currencies or existing financial systems, although I would love to see
that play out. I would like it to augment the current systems with new
ways to trade, more effective ways to put wealth to use, more
transparent ways to work together. It needs to put banks and
governments on the edge of their seats and keep them a lot more aware
of their obligation to reasonably deal with their control over over
money.
</p>
<p> Having a transparent, technologically sound system for exchanging
value is in the interest of many. I'm sure bitcoin has many things
that can be improved. Its its complexity of use and the rather clumsy
exposure of meaningless addresses come to mind, but the foundation is
solid and the issues I found are by no means critical or
unsolvable. The fact that bitcoin, the program, is open source does
help to understand and validate the system and thus gain my
trust. This contrasts on many levels with the services offered to me
through financial companies.
