<p>
I moved over my Moveable Type powered blog over to a Xaraya
install. Long overdue, given that I am a developer on Xaraya, it is
sort of obligatory to run the blog from that package.
</p>

<p>
I tried to mimick the old look as much as possible. While Xaraya is
certainly more flexible and some things were much easier to do than in
MT, I also noticed that the finesses of MT will take a while to move
over.
</p>

<p>
Some things which will take some time to come back the full MT way:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trackback functionaliy; while Xaraya supports this, it will take some manual effort to get it to be a friendly player;
</li>
<li>Inline RDF Moveable type supports by default for autodiscovery;
</li>
<li>Some templating work is still left (like directly showing the older
entries);
</li>
<li>The support for uploading images directly with blog postings;
</li>
<li>The extended API support.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The above is one of the reasons i moved over, so i have a real life
itch to implement those things in Xaraya. We'll see
</p>
