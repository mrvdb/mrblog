And a client naturally...Once you have the blog server side set up,
you obviously need something better than a webform to post the
ramblings.


Installation of mozblog(http://mozblog.mozdev.org) went with some
hickups. I really like the fact of pressing Alt-P, jotting down
something and going back to where I was. No separate application, no
nothing.We should seriously considering making the mozblog suitable
for Xaraya. This kind of blogging is something I can relate to.
