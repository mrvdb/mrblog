<p>Spent the most part of this day getting http links in thunderbird to open in firebird. Still not succeeding. This is pathetic, i'm pretty sure my local configuration is not broken. I'm NOT a linux newbie and can't get it to work.
</p>
<p>There's no option to configure it, the system wide configuration in gnome is at least confusing, and no obvious way to debug it. On a related issue; had to install the MozEx extension and write a custom shell script to get mailto links to open the compose window in thunderbird when clicked on in firebird.
</p>
<p>What are these people expecting from me?
