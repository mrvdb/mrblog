And a client naturally...Once you have the blog server side set up,
you obviously need something better than a webform to post the
ramblings. Installation of mozblog(http://mozblog.mozdev.org) went
with some hickups. I really like the fact of pressing Alt-P, jotting
down something and going back to where I was. No separate
application, no nothing.We should seriously considering making the
mozblog suitable for Xaraya. This kind of blogging is something I
can relate to.
