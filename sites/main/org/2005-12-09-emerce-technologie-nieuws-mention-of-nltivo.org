#+BEGIN_HTML
<blockquote> De Tivo-dienst is officieel alleen beschikbaar in de
  Verenigde Staten en het Verenigd Koninkrijk. In Nederland bestaan
  ook TiVo-gebruikers. Wie het apparaat hier wil gebruiken moet wel
  flink sleutelen aan het oorspronkelijke apparaat. De <a
  href="http://www.nltivo.net/index.php/NLTiVo:About" title="NLTivo
  community site">Nederlandse TiVo-gemeenschap</a> assisteert hierbij
  </blockquote> <blockquote> Translation: "The TiVo-service is
  officially only available in the United States an the the United
  Kingdom. In the Netherlands there are also TiVo-users. Who wants to
  use the device here, has to perform quite a bit of tinkering with
  the original device. <a

  community site">The Dutch TiVo community</a> has some useful info."

This community site was started by Dennis and myself. Lately Dennis
has done some great work making it easy to create a fully working TiVo
in the Netherlands. The critical point is having high quality guide
data. Dennis runs a Guide Data server for the community. Several
others, including me, run their own emulators for further development.

While it would be great to have an official TiVo service in the
Netherlands, it would also destroy the community as it exists today,
because the moment an official TiVo subscription can be had, our
efforts become illegal, not only by the way TiVo license it hard- and
software, but also by the licenses imposed by the several TiVo groups
themselves. Most of the open tools developed have an explicit mention
you can only use them if there is no official TiVo service available
in your area"
