<p>Today the BK-view module I wrote for Xaraya went into a live site which can actually be used for something usefull.</p>
<p>The site http://bk.xaraya.com is the BitKeeper central for the Xaraya project. The BK-view module is used to browse through all of the clones used in the project, which is in the mean time a rather large number, and I've only included the top level clones.</p>
<p>The clones from the clones are not even in there.</p>
