</p>
<p>Well, this would be perfect for Xaraya and DDF operations. The irc
voting we sometimes do with the notorious
<strong>+1
</strong> and
<strong>-1
</strong> lines works only so far. If someone doesn't sum up the votes
and puts it on a mailinglist, it's quickly forgotten what the vote was
about and the decision gets lost in the day-to-day work.
</p>
<p>With eVote connecting to mailman, which we use in the Xaraya group,
this would theoretically mean, as we have connected all mailing lists
to NNTP that we can have votes and petitions on all mailing lists and
newsgroups.
</p>
<p>Especially for the DDF, which can possibly hold a greater number of
projects this can highly simplify the decision making
process. Definitely worth looking into.
