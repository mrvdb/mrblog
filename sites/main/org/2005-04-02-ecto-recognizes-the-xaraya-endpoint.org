I dropped a quick message to Adriaan Tijsseling, the developer of the
amazing [[http://ecto.kung-foo.tv][Ecto blogging application]] package with a number of
questions. One of the questions was whether Xaraya could be included
as an endpoint in the accounts screen.

This morning, I fired up Ecto, and the update which contained it was already there! Man, this
guy is quick.

Awesome!
