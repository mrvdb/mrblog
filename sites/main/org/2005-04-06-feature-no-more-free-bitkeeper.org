[[http://kerneltrap.org/node/4966][Feature: No More Free BitKeeper]]:

Linus, not interested in a one sided deal even when he's on the
winning side, decided for this and other reasons to migrate away from
BitKeeper and to begin looking for an alternative.

It will be interesting to see how this works out.
