Creating content with Blocklayout in Xaraya is flexible and every
once in a while i want to take it for a spin. In the past i've played
with creating a XUL theme where Xaraya served it directly as the XUL
mimetype, this time i've been playing with creating a calendar feed of
any Xaraya content which has some sort of a date attached to
it.
What happens is that the content of some part of Xaraya is fed
into an iCal theme which produces output according to the
[[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt][iCal standard]] Blocklayout sets the right content type for us, which
allows clients like Apple's iCal or Gnome's evolution to 'subscribe'
to the calendar feed.

Above is an example on how that could look in
the iCal application. The Feed block on the right side allows you to
do exactly what is described here if you have a client which allows
you to subscribe to iCal feeds. I've tested it with Evolution and
iCal. The concept is still young but I can see a lot of potential in
this.
