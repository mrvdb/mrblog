title: Buying apple hardware just to run linux?

#+END_HTML

As mentioned in my previous post, I moved back to using Linux as my
desktop operating system, coming from OSX. I have a couple of notes on
the why and some observations about it which may be of interest.

My main machine has been a macbook pro 17 inch (or powerbook when they
still had a ppc in them) for a couple of years now and I was pretty
much a happy camper using OSX. OSX has represented an ideal mix for my
long unix based experience and the need for screen candy and proper
support of drivers which make usage of the hardware flawless.

In short, my hardware broke down. That is, it broke down a bit. Every
once in a while I'd get coloured stripes on my screen or a yellowish
glow or fonts of which the letter 'm' would not display correctly (go
figure). Annoying, but fixable with a reboot and I could live with
that, at least for a short period of time. When the machine started
rebooting spontaneously and I started losing work because of it,
replacement seemed the only option left.

As the problem was intermittent and seemed a bit related to how hard I
was hitting the cpu with my compiler whip, I decided, before scrapping
the machine, to install ubuntu linux on it, just to see how it would
deal with the same hardware error and to have a look at the new ubuntu
(at that time Lucid) release.

The hardware problem was still present under Linux, but I was able to
control it. A major help was to be able to control the fanspeed and
thus the temperature of the machine. This was something that I never
succeeded in doing under OSX. Perhaps I didn't look hard enough, or
was not experienced enough in OSX details or whatever. Fact remains, I
got to control the fans in Linux within the hour and with that a large
portion of the problem.

By carefully configuring display settings and upgrading to newer
customized kernels I am now in the situation that my machine is
basically back to a state where "/scrapping it/" sounds ridiculous and
it's good to go for a while.

The above process took about 3 to 4 weeks. After that I realized that
the level of control I had over my machine felt really good.

Having worked on a daily basis under Linux a notable observation was
that I didn't really miss anything from OSX, apart from a dedicated
blogging application (MarsEdit) and possibly iTunes. Apart from those,
most of the applications I used a lot are also available on
Linux. Emacs and Claws mail actually run a lot better on Linux than
they do on OSX. I do have a solution for the blogging (org2blog with
emacs), but replacing iTunes is still a problem;

So, now I have apple hardware all over and not using OSX on any of
it. At first, that does not sound like a smart thing to do.
From a financial point of view for one, most people argue that apple
hardware may be expensive, but a lot of quality software comes
included. Throwing the sofware away, which is effectively what you do
when you go running linux on that hardware, does not make much sense
then, does it?

What I found however, is that it is quite a challenge to match the
macbook pro specs, build quality and features like the magsafe
connector for the same price. Add to that an ability to drive the 30"
screen and it's pretty darn difficult to find a machine other than the
macbook pro series from apple. (I was charmed by the Sony Vaio Z
series, but it can't drive the 30"-screen and it's a bit more
expensive than an MBP too) Viewed from this (admittedly biased) angle
it makes sense, even if you don't plan on running OSX to buy a
macbook pro again.

On top of all what is above, there is another issue which has been
bothering me, and apparently I'm not alone in this, is the general
direction Apple is taking. While I love their attention to detail and
precise execution of production of their hardware, I loathe the way
they treat (iPhone) developers and their strategy of control and
censorship. The latest preview of OSX Lion only confirmed my
concerns. Notably the appstore developments and the limitation of
freedom to run sofware is bothering me. I guess the balance was held
in some way with their sort-of-open contributions to several pieces of
sofware (darwin, calendarserver, launchd etc.) but lately the scale
tipped over for me.

I fully realize this is all subjective and food for rants and all, but
hey, it's my blog. :-)
