Many people got attracted to bitcoin the last couple of months. This
explosion of interest probably caused the monetary value of bitcoins
to show the same shape as the google trend-line chart pictured below.

In this article I will ignore the exponential increase in monetary
value since its inception and focus on some intrinsic properties of
bitcoin and why those are valuable as such.

The sudden interest in bitcoin is not coincidental in my opinion. The
bitcoin /ecosystem/ tries to solve a number of problems with the current
systems of trade, currencies and the economical structures in general
we have in place for them, like our national banks, the currency and
stock exchanges and the IMF. The last couple of years we have been
confronted, sometimes in very painful ways, with the shortcomings of
those systems and, not in the last place, the shortcomings of the
people involved; all of us.

The financial crisis is obviously a complex issue and no single cause
can be determined. Whatever these causes are however, they have
provided a trigger for many to look for alternatives to create wealth
or, more important, create ways to hang on to wealth, especially if there
is not a lot of it to hang on to.

For the rest of this article I'm going to assume you know how bitcoins
work. You will not have to be an expert in economics, cryptography or
computer programming, but a basic understanding of the workings of
bitcoin will be necessary. The websites http://bitcoin.org en
http://weusecoins.com are good starting points.  Some of the points
below won't make sense if you do not have at least a rudimentary
understanding of how the system operates.

** The trust issue
  Most people will worry (a lot) if they have money issues. This alone
  dictates that you absolutely want to trust all parties involved with
  handling your money.

  These parties include the people you receive money from, like your
  employer, the local banks you trust to keep your money safe for you,
  the government which monitors the usage of it, but also the 'coins'
  that represent the money. All of these need your continued trust,
  and that is a lot to ask. Especially if things do go wrong at times.

  Employers need your trust that they possess enough of the 'stuff' to
  be able pay you for work, local banks need your trust so you let
  them keep your savings, governments and central banks need your trust
  that they won't screw up (by printing too much money for example)
  and the coins also need your trust that they are the real deal. All
  of the examples in some way betrayed our trust in the past. That has
  an effect on people. It may not be visible for a while, but broken
  trust /sticks/.

  Bitcoin tries to address some of the trust issues people have; I
  think it was one of the main motivations for creating a system like
  bitcoin. It does this, amongst other things, by shifting a few of
  the trust items from people/institutions to verifiable technology.

  For example, instead of trusting a bank to verify transactions to be
  valid, because they are the only party who can oversee all
  transactions, trust is placed in hashing techniques to demonstrate
  that, for example, double spending is very, very unlikely. These
  techniques are easier verified and proven to be right than the bank
  which is now responsible for it, if only because we don't have
  access to these verifications. The major goal of both verifications
  is to prevent the same coin to be spent multiple times. (fraud)

  Another trust shift is the 'keep-save' mechanism. If you keep your
  savings on your savings-account at your bank, the combination of the
  banks trustworthiness and, should that fail, the (limited) guarantee
  the government gives on your savings makes that you can feel
  comfortable on parking your money there. With bitcoin, your trust
  will be in cryptographic tools and /the network/ so you keep all your
  savings in a computer file. The mechanism you could use to keep it
  safe is to encrypt that file and spread it all over the network to
  many places to minimise the chances of losing all copies of
  it. There is no-one to trust but yourself, but there's also no-one
  which can protect you in case you screw up yourself.

** Distance is not important, value is
   Another property of the bitcoin system, not unique to it but
   especially well implemented I think, is the way it makes the
   distance to receivers irrelevant and allows value to be put to use
   effectively. I'll give an example below.

   Say I want to transfer 2 euros to someone which is in a country far
   away from mine. The amount of time and money it takes to get this
   modest amount into the hands of that someone distant is ridiculous
   in the current financial system. My bank does provide a service
   but it will cost me at least 10 euros, double that amount if I want
   to get it done 'fast'. Fast, in this case meaning within 24 hours!
   For larger sums, the cost may be acceptable, but for small amounts
   both time and cost are ridiculous.

   There are many services which try to solve at least part of the
   problem outlined above. Services like paypal with on-line accounts
   to make things go faster, or proxy companies which gather up all the
   small amounts and transfer to the real supplier when things have
   piled up. Up until bitcoin I did not encounter a service which chose
   the simplest concept for this problem: "Set up a secure, verifiable,
   immediate non-refundable transaction between the involved parties."

   I do not believe the technology to do this has not been available to
   banks and/or credit card companies, so that can't be the reason
   they have not implemented a cheaper and more efficient system. It's not
   very hard to imagine what their reason is though. Distance used to
   be a major hurdle, it is not anymore.

   The key differences bitcoin provides here are:
   - the receiver and sender communicate directly, trust is a lot
     easier to maintain if there are less parties involved. "No middle
     man needed, nor wanted"
   - the 'act' of payment is almost immediate, the receiver can check
     almost immediately that a transaction has been made. (Verification
     for validity by the network can take a while though) In relation
     to the 24 hours described in the first paragraph this can
     certainly be considered very fast, near /real-time/
   - a transaction fee is optional. If you specify one, you make it
     more attractive for others in the network to check your
     transaction and have a go at collecting that fee. If swift
     transaction handling is not important, but transferring, say 0.05 euro,
     to a certain person *is* important, bitcoin is about the only way I
     know to do that effectively.


   Remember, the amount of 0.05 euro may not be much to you and me, but
   there are parts in the world where it can buy you a meal or a bottle
   of water. The fact alone that bitcoin makes these kinds of
   transactions possible is enough reason to give it more than a casual
   look.

   Bitcoin increases the value of my â‚¬ 0.05 by allowing effective use.

** No unreasonable control
   It's probably true that bitcoin, or systems like it, scares
   financial companies and governments and therefore will have a rough
   time ahead. This scare is in part caused by a fear of decreasing
   control over the system compared to the /classic/ system. Almost all
   economic commentators or government representatives will argue that
   'some form of control' is needed to correct and stabilise the
   system. I'm not very convinced of that being effective or wanted
   anymore.

   Recently, the unreasonable control over money flow in the wikileaks
   dry-out attempt confirmed this once again for me. It doesn't really
   matter if companies like mastercard and paypal decide not to handle
   transactions for wikileaks themselves or that they have been put
   under pressure to do so. The fact that it happens shows they have
   control over where I spent my money. I don't want that. Bitcoin
   offers a system where this type of control is impossible by means of
   the system itself; personal threats will be effective I'm afraid
   with any system.

   Next to the self-control over spending purposes, anonymity is also
   important for some people. The example often used, mostly in
   critical pieces on bitcoin, are criminals. Bitcoin makes it
   possible, when used in certain ways, to bring money from A to B
   without exposing identities to each-other and to third parties. This
   is obviously attractive for criminals, including people who want to
   evade taxes.  This is a valid concern and should be addressed
   properly, but I don't think it has anything to do with bitcoin as
   such. With regard to *this* aspect, bitcoin has no other properties
   than cash, it's just more effective and easier to use than
   exchanging bits of paper money. The real use-case here is the
   non-criminal people who want to perform semi-anonymous transactions
   for valid reasons.

** So, what's the verdict?
  Bitcoin is a good idea, generally speaking. From a technological
  viewpoint it's excellent. It's trivial that libertarians and
  anarchists will be attracted by bitcoins, we don't need to argue the
  case for them. The challenge is to present the extra-, not the
  replacement-, values of bitcoin for all the other people out there.
  I have touched on three of the most important ones to me. There are more
  properties which make it very attractive as an alternate choice for
  exchanging value.

  Many 'digital cash' systems have been presented before bitcoin, but
  for all of them I could point out critical weaknesses within a very
  short time. For many of them this was not even a technical weakness,
  but an organisational (like a paranoid initiator, looking for
  patent protection) or an economical issue (creating a metal backed
  currency in the hands of a private company). With bitcoin there are
  certainly weaknesses in the system, but I have not been able to find
  a critical one upfront.

  The goal of bitcoin is not necessarily to take over existing
  currencies or existing financial systems, although I would love to
  see that play out. I would like it to augment the current systems
  with new ways to trade, more effective ways to put wealth to use,
  more transparent ways to work together. It needs to put banks and
  governments on the edge of their seats and keep them a lot more
  aware of their obligation to reasonably deal with their control over
  over money.

  Having a transparent, technologically sound system for exchanging
  value is in the interest of many. I'm sure bitcoin has many things
  that can be improved. Its its complexity of use and the rather
  clumsy exposure of meaningless addresses come to mind, but the foundation is
  solid and the issues I found are by no means critical or
  unsolvable. The fact that bitcoin, the program, is open source does
  help to understand and validate the system and thus gain my
  trust. This contrasts on many levels with the services offered to me
  through financial companies.

  - argue, carefully, that the most probable weakness of bitcoin is that
    people will be responsible for keeping their own wallet safe. This
    is not a trivial task to do proper. Many people I know have no
    problem sending passwords or other sensitive information over the
    wire. When a wallet.dat file has been sent over the wire, all money
    in it must be considered at risk and must be spent immediately by
    transferring it to new addresses into a newly created wallet.
