<p>As more and more open source software runs well on windows (something which has not always been that way to my great frustration), becomes more cross platform (e.g. <a href="http://www.xchat.org">xchat</a>, <a href="http://www.sodipodi.com">sodipodi</a>, <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net">gaim</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">openoffice</a> ), i found myself needing an apt-get equivalent on windows.</p>
<p>Usually windows versions of OSS are either file archives to be dumped into their install directory, or wrapped in a (big) windows installer. I <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?q=apt-get+win32">searched</a> for a windows version for apt-get, but got not much to work with / from.</p>
<p>I wonder why, can't be that difficult. Shame i have no credit left on my time account.</p>
