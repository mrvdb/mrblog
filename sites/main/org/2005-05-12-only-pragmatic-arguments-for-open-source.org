<a id="1043" href="http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1043" name="1043">Computer Economics: research on strategic and financial management of information systems</a> has results on a survey they held on why organisations choose an Open Source solution.

<blockquote>
  "Computer Economics recently conducted a survey of visitors to its website regarding the perceived advantages in the use of open source software. Although not a scientific sample, the results are nevertheless startling"

<p style="text-align:center"></p><img src="/files/2008/11/opensource-reasons.gif" width="269" height="300" alt="opensource-reasons.gif" /> From those results I largely miss 2 things:

<ol>
  <li>If "less dependence on vendor" is the main factor, i would like to see some cases where that really mattered, not by showing people who can't switch from MS (we know there is a lock-in there), but by showing the ease of switching OSS providers.</li>

  <li>Apparently only the economical arguments count here. Which might make sense considering the focus area of Computer Economics, but what i would like to know if the argument of "freedom" or "right thing to do" was asked, or mentioned at all.</li>
</ol>Also, why these results are startling is beyond me.
