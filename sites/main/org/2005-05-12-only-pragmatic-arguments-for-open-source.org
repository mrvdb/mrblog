[[http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1043][Computer Economics: research on strategic and financial management of
information systems]] has results on a survey they held on why
organisations choose an Open Source solution.

From those results I largely miss 2 things:

 1. If "less dependence on vendor" is the main factor, i would like to
    see some cases where that really mattered, not by showing people
    who can't switch from MS (we know there is a lock-in there), but
    by showing the ease of switching OSS providers.
 2. Apparently only the economical arguments count here. Which might
    make sense considering the focus area of Computer Economics, but
    what i would like to know if the argument of "freedom" or "right
    thing to do" was asked, or mentioned at all.

Also, why these results are startling is beyond me.
