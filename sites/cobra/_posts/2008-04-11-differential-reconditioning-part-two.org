<p>I did not trust my efforts of replacing the pinion seal; it looks kinda funny with the rubber <strong>on</strong> the axis instead of behind it. Add to that the fact the procedure could not be finished properly because of the front nut being loose to start with, I decided to have <a href="http://www.jaguar-kolvenbach.com" title="Kolvenbach">Kolvenbach</a> take a look at it. Glad I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/2668366497/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3209/2668366497_355cc11f90.jpg" class="flickr" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Not only was the pinion seal not installed properly, it was completely the wrong seal! On top of that the output shaft seals were also the wrong ones. A previous owner of the diff must have had the same problem as me.</p>
<p>Anyways, all seals replaced now by people who know what they are doing. The new pinion seal properly sits behind the flange now.</p>

<p>While they had the diff in parts I figured they could just as easily give it a spray. I rounded it off by installing the backplate with new stainless bolts and a diff we have!</p>

<p>I might give the base housing another spray, or use some POR chassis coat on it.</p>
