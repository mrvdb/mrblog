I did not trust my efforts of replacing the pinion seal; it looks
kinda funny with the rubber <strong>on</strong> the axis instead of
behind it. Add to that the fact the procedure could not be finished
properly because of the front nut being loose to start with, I decided
to have [[http://www.jaguar-kolvenbach.com][Kolvenbach]] take a look at it. Glad I did.

Not only was the pinion seal not installed properly, it was completely
the wrong seal! On top of that the output shaft seals were also the
wrong ones. A previous owner of the diff must have had the same
problem as me.

Anyways, all seals replaced now by people who know what they are
doing. The new pinion seal properly sits behind the flange now.

While they had the diff in parts I figured they could just as easily
give it a spray. I rounded it off by installing the backplate with new
stainless bolts and a diff we have!

I might give the base housing another spray, or use some POR
chassis coat on it.
