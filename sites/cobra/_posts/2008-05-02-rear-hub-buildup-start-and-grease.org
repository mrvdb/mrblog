<p>While waiting on the return of all the suspension components from the galvanizer, there is not much to do. One thing is to prepare the rear hubs for buildup.</p>
<p>I started to put in the bearing tracks. The fulcrum ones are relatively easy.</p>

Even with the proper bearing drifts it takes quite a bit of hammering to drive them home. After having done two, or rather one and a half i phoned the local garage with the question if i could use their press. That made it a lot easier! It did hurt a bit too see my hubs getting dirty again though.

I ended up with <a href="http://www.kroon-oil.com/en/products/catalogue/seg_aut/krgr/402/automotive/kroon-oil-greases/high-grade-grease-ht-q9">Kroon Oil Q9</a>. It had the words 'high grade' and 'automotive' on it, came with a free grease gun, which looks a whole lot easier than my current one....
