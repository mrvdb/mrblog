Searching for a [[/2008/11/18/it-should-have-been-easier.html][replacement]] Universal Joint for the one rear axle, I
have discovered that they have their own parallel universe!! There's a
large set of manufacturers which may, or may not, produce the proper
Universal Joint. They may, or may not, have a web presence on which
they may, or may not, mention the specifications of their products.

Once talking to a representative of one of these companies, he may,
or may not know what he is talking about. He will gladly tell you that
the product you are looking for may, or may not be in stock and may,
or may not fit the application you want to use it for.

When you finally find 2 or 3 models, which may fit the application,
their price difference of around â‚¬ 50 euro's a piece may, or may not
be explained by their specifications. The most expensive one may, or
may not last longer than the cheaper model. There may even, or may not
be a story behind them which sounds plausible, but can not be
checked.

At the point where you have made up your own mind on what UJ you
will purchase, the supplier may, or may not sell it directly to you
and may, or may not tell you to call a local dealer. Calling this
dealer may, or may not put you into contact with a person asking you
what the price of the item was the distributor may or may not have
promised you.

Once the UJ has been ordered it may or may not arrive tomorrow
morning.
