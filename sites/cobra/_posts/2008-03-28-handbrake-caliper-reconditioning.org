<p>Got my parts back from galvanising today. What a difference a little shine makes! Most of the items were from the donor handbrake calipers, which were in pretty bad shape when i got them.</p>

<p>Using the rivnut tool i bought a while ago, the little covers were repaired with a new rivnut and although i still am missing a bolt and some locking thingies, assembling the caliper was pretty rewarding.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the inside, the clip i have seems different than what i can find in my manuals. Also the spring on the right seems to be in the middle of the path were the missing bolt should go to hold the covers.</p>

<p>The other caliper should not be a problem.</p>
<p>The galvanising was sort of an experiment; i found a company nearby which asks a flat rate for any 'box full of metal parts'. They galvanise with blue and yellow finish (<em>blue-ish</em> and <em>yellow-ish</em> i guess). I asked what the limit was for the parts, but they didn't give me one, so perhaps i should bring the whole set of suspension parts too?</p>
