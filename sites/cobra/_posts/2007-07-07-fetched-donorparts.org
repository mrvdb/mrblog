<p>Drove up to John Kox from <a href="http://www.daxbenelux.com">Dax Benelux</a> today to fetch two jaguar axles and a differential. The diff looked pretty good as is, as it has been in a Cobra until recently. I saw a little leakage on the front seal, so it needs reconditioning anyways.</p>
<p>The axles are horrid as usual, but i trust they will clean up nicely when i'm done with them.<br /></p>

<p>Man, these things are heavy.</p>
