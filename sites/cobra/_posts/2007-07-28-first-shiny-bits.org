<p>Went to <a href="http://www.daxbenelux.com">DAX Benelux</a> today to exchange the disassembled calipers for reconditioned ones. I dont actually need them right away, as there is no part finished yet to which i can attach a caliper, but it replaces 4 rusty parts for 4 shiny parts, which feels like progress.<br /></p>

</div>For any part to be ready for anything, the postman brought in the nasty stuff this morning, representing the 4 phases most of the parts will need to go through.<br />

  <li>Marine Clean; get rid of dirt and grease (i doubt there is any left after the soda-soak they all got, but i'm following instructions here)</li>

  <li>Metal Ready; acid plus zinc-phosphate to get the metal ready to receive the real thing;</li>

  <li>POR15; the coat that is going to protect the parts from rust;</li>

  <li>Chassis Black; the coat that is going to protect the POR15 from UV light; as far as there will be any under the car. (and yes, i got a bit more than just that tiny can there)</li>
</ol>These and the preceding electrolytic treatment should be more than adequate to keep the donorparts free from rust and protected from whatever may be out there.
