<p style="text-align: left">Assembling the rear driveshafts with the universal joints is an easy job (<a href="http://cobra.mrblog.nl/2007/07/first-day-first-problems.html">unlike the disassembly</a> of them). Especially using my press, getting in the Universal Joints is very easy to do and the first was completed in no time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/3038412313/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/3038412313_22680f5889.jpg" class="flickr portrait" alt="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The second however, disaster! The first joint went in smoothly but when I pressed in the second the complete "top lid" of one of the caps broke off!!! Aargh. No idea how this happened. I did not subject the joints to excessive force, although using a press sort of hides these forces.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">So, after a minute or two of swearing I pressed out the one joint which, thankfully, did not damage the shaft and came out pretty easily. It should just be a matter of purchasing a new UJ now and pressing that in. All in all, the job took me 4 hours where it should have been like 10 minutes.</p>
