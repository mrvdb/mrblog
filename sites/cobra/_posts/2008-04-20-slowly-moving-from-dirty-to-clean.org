<p>The amount of dirty parts is shrinking considerably now. Especially after blasting the parts that are 'ready for painting' look amazing.</p>

<p>It makes the parts almost look like there is a paint finish on them.</p>

<p>I also got my hands on a broken bench drill. It's a new machine but the motor does not start well. Bit of a gamble, but it sounds like the startup capacitor is either the wrong size or broken. It's too big for my multimeter so i can not be sure if it is Ok or not.</p>

<p>Opening up the motor itself revealed a loose wire?!? Seconds before the motor ran smooth, so i must have torn it loose on opening up the motor. Other than that, the motor looked fine. I also noticed the motor got quite hot when trying to get it to run, but i'm hoping that is the abnormal load on the secondary coil during the testing. If I can get this fixed by a capacitor replacement, i got a really good deal! If not, i got a lousy one.</p>
