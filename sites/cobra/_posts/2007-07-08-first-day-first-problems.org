Spent the whole Sunday covered in grease; disassembling the rear
axle. The start was pretty much ok, got the lower wishbones loose
pretty easily. The only somewhat interesting part was getting the
bearings out. Two sockets of appropriate size and a vice:

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 425 %}
#+END_HTML

and out they come in no time:

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 426 %}
#+END_HTML

I wish i could say the same for getting the universal joints out
of the drive shafts. I already had them soaked with WD40 since the day
before. They were all so tight that the vice handle had to be
lengthened with a meter of steel pipe and my full weight applied to
that (which is a good 10 kilo's more than it used to be since i
stopped smoking). When the day was over, i managed to get 2 universal
joints removed. The first was relatively easy (took me only 2 Â½
hours). The second was worse and its removal damaged one of the
shafts:

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 427 %}
#+END_HTML

Apparently the thing was so tight it scraped some of the metal into
a rim. Obviously, that has to be removed again later on, hmm will that
be a problem on reassembly?<br />

I'm still suppressing thoughts on the remaining two joints....
