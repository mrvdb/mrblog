It's about time I made up my mind about a gearbox to put behind the
LS2. When I started to focus on a gearbox I had not a very good idea
what criteria to use to evaluate gearboxes. I sort of tried to
deliberately ignore (but not completely) the obvious choices in the
different forums; not because they are bad or anything, but I wanted
to reason my way into a gearbox choice based on technical criteria and
personal preferences.


So, the first thing I did was read up on how the thing actually works.

The way I look at it, the drivetrain from engine to the wheel on the
road is a divider, where you can control the division factor by
selecting gears. Other than the gearbox there are is only one other
factor which determines how 1 turn of the engine-output-shaft
translates into a movement of the rear wheels.

This is the differential ratio, 3.54 in my case. Once the gear is
known, you can calculate how many rotations of the engine it takes to
let the wheels rotate once.


How that translates into road-speed and handling, which is what I
am ultimately interested in, is a bit more complicated. The size of
the (rear) wheels is one thing, their grip on the road and the
influence of all sorts of drag are others.


<p>It is pretty easy to create a set of graphs with the above
information and the gear ratios of the gearbox. These graphs show you
rpm vs (ideal) road-speed and a 'shift behaviour' graph, which shows
the drops in rpm given a shiftpoint. Here's what that looks like,
given a Tremec TKO600 gearbox and 275/40-18 rear wheels.</p

Obviously this is all theoretical. The speeds will be lower in
practice as drag increases with speed and how the 'dry numbers' will
translate into actual experience is the big surprise I guess. What can
be determined from the numbers however, is if the setup of
engine,gearbox and differential makes sense overall and helps giving a
quick visual overview of the length of the gears, an indication of the
effect of the overdrive etc. The second graph above clearly shows the
length of the overdrive vs the first 4 gears.

I've done this graphing for a couple of
gearboxes and stared at the numbers and graphs for a day. Combined
with my personal preferences these are the conclusions I came to:
 - manual gearbox;
   'grand touring' theme I'd like an overdrive in top gear(s) which
   gives me a cruising speed of around 100 km/h at 2000 rpm;
 - 'open box', that is, the gearbox needs to be documented and
   serviceable (by me);

After all that, the choice boiled down for me to a Tremec TKO600
5-speed or the Tremec T56 6-speed (big surprise... not!). Having no
hands on experience with either of those two boxes, I spoke to a
couple of people having some experience with one or both. Apart from
the obvious differences like 5 vs 6 speed and the TKO being a bit
stronger on torque allowance, the main thing I distilled from the
comments was that the TKO is the more 'raw' box, more aggressive
perhaps and better suited to track (ab)use, and the T56 being a bit
softer and perhaps more suited for cruising.

Making my mind up, I think I'll opt for the TKO 600. The bigger torque
number gives some playing room with the engine, and I think the LS2
has enough torque to already let me skip 2 gears, so why bother with a
6-speed?
