#+title: Running out of air

I am not sure what happened exactly but last week the power went
out and I could not get it back on. The earth leakage circuit breaker
activated and kept doing that when reset. It turned out the compressor
was the cause. Unplugging it allowed the power to come back on. This
weekend I had the time to figure out what had happened. Opening up the
case and looking inside did not give much hope:

#+END_HTML

While the cracked housing is bad, that didn't explain the earth
leakage. Opening up the motor itself did though:

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 394 %}
#+END_HTML

That's fried! I'm hesitant to just put another motor back in. I'm
thinking of turning the whole compressor in and getting one back with
a little more grunt and running on 3 phase current
