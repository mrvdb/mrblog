<p>The missing Nord-Lock washers have arrived. This means I can, in theory, finish the complete buildup of the front suspension. First off was fixing the brake discs to the wheel hubs. As mentioned, instead of the normal spring washers I'm using the Nord-Lock washers where applicable. This is such a place.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/3024220865/"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">When assembling with these washers it's somewhat important to watch the surface friction and make sure the pair of rings stay in their "compressed" state. I do this by sort of overlubricating the contact surface to make sure the surface friction is less than the friction between the rings. After that's it's just a matter of torque-ing all ten of them up and taking a picture.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align: left">Next step would be to bring the uprights and the hubs together, at which point I realised there were 2 oil seals involved needing a 12 hour soak before assembling. So, that more or less stopped the assembly on this part for today.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">And I had them all layed out so neatly.....</p>
