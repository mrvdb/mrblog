As most of the other kit car builders i've met, i'm drooling over
new tools too. I got myself an air compressor a while ago, but it
didnt include an oil dispenser nor air filter kit. Today i fetched the
parts for that and assembled them into a 'bar' which will end up on a
wall-mounted plate in the new garage.

The part on the left is the air filter / reducer, right is the oil
dispenser. I created two outlets, one after just the air filter and
one after the oil dispenser. That way i can use compressed air with
oil (for rotating tools etc. which need lubrication) by hooking up at
the end. By connecting in the middle it will just be clean air without
the oil; I gathered that for spraying paint oil is the last thing you
want in the air flow, but i have not much experience with these
tools.
