Fitting the GD lower wishbone bracket to the wishbone seemed like a
nice quick job. I layed out everything needed, took the obligatory
picture ...

and did a trial fit, only to find out the bracket would not fit. (both
of them in fact). In the end I had to put the wishbones under the
press and squeeze it a bit to be able to get the bolts in. Let's call
it an '/engineering fit/'.

And the finished article:

I probably should have painted the other holes which are not used; I
did not realise it at the time.

Here's also a detail of the Nord-Lock washers I'm using. As a rule
of thumb I'm adding around 20% to the specified torque numbers in the
jaguar manual. With the nordlock-washers that should lead to about the
same bolt tension.
