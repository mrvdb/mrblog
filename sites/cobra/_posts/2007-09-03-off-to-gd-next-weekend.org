<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://gdcars.com" title="Gardner Douglas">GD</a> is having an Open Day next weekend. As my chassis is probably in the jig right now i thought it would be nice to visit them. Combined with a small trip through the UK, sounds like a nice little holiday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I hope I can get a look at my chassis there and shoot some pictures of it. Obviously the planned 'ride-along' in the GD427 is something i look forward too also.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The Garage is more or less 'done', just planning for some <a href="http://racedeck.com" title="Racedeck floor tiles">racedeck</a> stuff on the floor a bit later</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Oh, this is not how it actually looks at the moment (it's full of stuff again), but for rembering how it looks empty and clean and all...<br /></p>
