[[http://gdcars.com][GD]] is having an Open Day next weekend. As my chassis is probably in
the jig right now i thought it would be nice to visit them. Combined
with a small trip through the UK, sounds like a nice little holiday.


I hope I can get a look at my chassis there and shoot some pictures of
it. Obviously the planned 'ride-along' in the GD427 is something i
look forward too also.

The Garage is more or less 'done', just planning for some [[http://racedeck.com][racedeck]]
stuff on the floor a bit later

Oh, this is not how it actually looks at the moment (it's full of
stuff again), but for rembering how it looks empty and clean and
all...
