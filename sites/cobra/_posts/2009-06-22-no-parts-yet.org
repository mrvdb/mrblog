#+title: No parts yetâ€¦
#+tags: cobra engine gearbox

So, no parts this week yet. Might as well tell a bit about what I'm waiting for.

Here's a rundown of the list of stuff I'm waiting for:

- engine mounts
- Tremex TKO 600 gearbox
- propshaft
- complete ss exhaust + headers


The position of the exhaust will be a bit different at the
back. Instead of the two exhaust pipes in the centre as is common for
GD type cobra's,

or an option seen lately, at the outside:

Mine will be somewhere in between those two types. I like the wider
looks of the exhausts, but not too wide as in the picture above, so
mine will be situated between the lights and the vertical chrome
thingies.

- omex 710 ECU + wiring
  The omex needs a little adjusting
  (amplification I think it is called) to be able to drive the
  injectors of the LS2 directly.
- alternator + bracket
- starter motor
- air intake box + filter
- radiator + fan kit
- straight thermostat outlet
  The thermostat on the LS2 is normally at an angle, which does not
  fit in the GD chassis, so a straight version needs to be
  mounted.
- SS header tank
- several hoses and wiring

- fuel pump and filter
  I would like to assemble the fuel pump like so:

  The above is a euro chassis, not the jag based one I have, so we'll
  have to see if there is enough room (esp. with the brake discs
  inboard).

- mechanical throttle
  Apparently the electronic throttle is not allowed, so it needs to be
  replaced by a mechanical one. Not sure what the precise reason for
  this is. but my guess would be that it has something to do with
  paranoia about (aftermarket) ECU's going berzerk and giving an
  uncontrollable full open throttle signal, with the imaginable
  consequences of that (esp. when an automatic gearbox is fitted).

  So, lots to do when the stuff gets here.
