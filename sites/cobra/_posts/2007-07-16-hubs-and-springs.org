<p>Eager to do something with the front axle (the rear stuff was waiting for me to get a puller) i decided to do some destruction work on the front springs. These things, while in the subframe, are under tension and need to be cut through before disassembling the rest. As I dont have a fancy torch to do this, the grinding disc was the tool of choice. I briefly tried sawing through the spring, no go!<br /></p>

<p>The local garage, <a href="http://www.bartelen.nl/">Autobedrijf Bartelen</a>, was kind enough to lend me a puller for the stubborn rear hub:<br /></p>
