#+title: Hubs and springs...

Eager to do something with the front axle (the rear stuff was
waiting for me to get a puller) i decided to do some destruction work
on the front springs. These things, while in the subframe, are under
tension and need to be cut through before disassembling the rest. As I
dont have a fancy torch to do this, the grinding disc was the tool of
choice. I briefly tried sawing through the spring, no go!

After going through one, the tension is still not off, but it
managed to damage the grinding disc allright.

The local garage, [[http://www.bartelen.nl/][Autobedrijf Bartelen]], was kind enough to lend me a
puller for the stubborn rear hub:
