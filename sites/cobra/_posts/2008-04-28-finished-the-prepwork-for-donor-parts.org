<p>Spent the better parts of two days with my hands in the blasting cabinet, peeking through a window which doesn't reveal a whole lot of what is inside, due to the dust.</p>

<p>After a while I fabricated a suction device from an old vacuum cleaner. That helped a lot, until the vacuum cleaner decided to short out and smoke a bit.</p>

<p>This morning I gathered all the parts and delivered them to <a href="http://www.galvin.nl" title="Electrolytic Galvanizing ">Galvin</a> where I had the hand brake parts treated too. This time the parts will be yellow-passivated, because that will provide a better profile for coatings than the blue passivation. Got some compliments of the guy at the factory, he said the parts he usually got to treat looked <em>a bit different</em>.</p>
