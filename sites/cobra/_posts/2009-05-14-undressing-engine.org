Having ordered a boat-load of engine-related parts, I started to
prepare the engine for it. This consists mostly of removing parts from
it and cleaning it up.

The exhaust headers, thermostat outlet and the flexplate all need
to be replaced by specific parts, either specifically made to fit the
GD (like the exhaust headers) or modified to fit into the engine
