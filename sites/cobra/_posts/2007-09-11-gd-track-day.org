<p>We had a little trip to the UK last weekend. Flew into London Stansted and hurried to the GD factory. Indeed, my chassis was being manufactured at the time. It was almost complete, a couple of brackets were missing and its powder coating. Even without that I was seriously impressed.</p>

<p>Saturday was mostly spent at the <a href="http://www.bruntingthorpe.com/" title="Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground">Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground</a> where a little circuit was available for the GD car owners to race their cars on and for people like myself to take a ride-along. Lots of goodies, like a very nicely done T70:<br /></p>
