<p>The hand brake of an XJS convertible I found on eBay arrived. Man, it does pay off to buy things in the US these days! For $45,- including transport to the Netherlands, which translates into roughly € 30,- for a used hand brake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/2669262728/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2669262728_363322756f.jpg" class="flickr" alt="" /></a><br /></p>
<p>For reference, when you buy this thing at a Jaguar Parts supplier it'll cost you something like € 130,- (not sure if that would be a new or a used one though) The return-spring and some spacers were not included, so I had to order those separately.</p>
<p>Cleaning the parts and re-assembling was a quick satisfying after dinner job. <a href="http://andysgd427.blogspot.com/2008/03/handbrake.html">Like Andy</a>, I too like the clean looks without the plastic handle, perhaps a pressed on piece of stainless steel instead of the plastic?</p>
