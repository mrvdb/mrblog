The hand brake of an XJS convertible I found on eBay arrived. Man,
it does pay off to buy things in the US these days! For $$45,-
including transport to the Netherlands, which translates into roughly
€ 30,- for a used hand brake.

For reference, when you buy this thing at a Jaguar Parts supplier
it'll cost you something like € 130,- (not sure if that would be a new
or a used one though) The return-spring and some spacers were not
included, so I had to order those separately.

Cleaning the parts and re-assembling was a quick satisfying after
dinner job. [[http://andysgd427.blogspot.com/2008/03/handbrake.html][Like Andy]], I too like the clean looks without the plastic
handle, perhaps a pressed on piece of stainless steel instead of the
plastic?
