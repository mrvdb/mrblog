That is, finishing up the garage. Next monday the new cement floor
will be 'poured in'.

So, we had to clear out everything and prepare the old floor for
receiving the new topcoat. There's a nice echo in the garage now ;-) I

only protected by a tent made up of the car lift with a large piece of
plastic over it.
