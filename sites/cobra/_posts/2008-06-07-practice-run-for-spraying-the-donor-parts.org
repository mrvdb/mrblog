<p>Given the amount of time already spent on preparing the donor parts, I am a bit hesitant to just start spraying the POR15 onto them without a bit of experience. As my motorbike needed new exhausts and as such had to be disassembled anyway, I prepared a couple of parts of the bike for spraying.</p>
<p>First, with the help of an <em>el cheapo</em> gazebo, I created an improvised spray booth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/2668447843/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2668447843_4822a481ea.jpg" class="flickr" alt="" /></a><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This worked much better than expected. After a bit of testing to get the viscosity of the chassis coat right and the spray gun adjusted, spraying the two bike parts was a quick job. The goal was to record the settings for the gun, the amount of solvent to use and, obviously, look at the end result.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The chassis coat, when sprayed, gives a unique finish, more matte than brushed. The breather is no luxury, this stuff is nasty.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The rest of the day was spent masking the jag parts. I'll probably spent tomorrow completing the masking and re-assembling the bike, so I can get it out of the way (you can just see it behind the tent on the left)</p>
