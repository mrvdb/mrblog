<p>To complete the engine&mdash;gearbox mating I just need one part
  now, which is the pilot bearing for the front of the gearbox. I
  ordered the original GM-part earlier, not realising my Tremec
  gearbox is of the Ford variety, which has slightly different
  dimensions. So, I still can not complete the mating, but there's
  lots of other (little) stuff I can complete, such as installing the
  fuel rail adapter.Click! Done.

<p>In the batch of parts I collected last week, I got the correct
  length drive-belt. Installing this is also a job of two seconds. The
  coverage on the pulley isn't that big, but the belt only has to
  drive the &nbsp;alternator, so it shouldbe ok.

<p>Startmotor can be bolted on now I have the correct length of the
  bolts. It's pretty close to the exhaust, I could not even get it
  assembled without removing the header, so the starter will probably
  need some heat shielding.&nbsp;
