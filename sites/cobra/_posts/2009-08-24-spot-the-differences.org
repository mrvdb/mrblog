So, the garage has yet again a new floor. The top one of the images below is from the current situation, the one below it is from the first attempt (already 2 years ago!). Spot the differences&#8230;

Let's hope this time the cracks will not appear. Having to clear out the garage, store everything somewhere and put everything back is definitely not my idea of a good time.

On the <em>cobra-building front</em> it's a bit quiet due to lack of parts, though I could do a few jobs on the chassis and suspension I guess, but for many of them I want to be able to take measurements of the engine, gearbox and other stuff before I do them.

I have been assured that the parts will be available for collection next week, so it should not be that long before I can get cracking at a slightly higher pace.
