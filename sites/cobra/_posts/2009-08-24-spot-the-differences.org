#+title: Spot the differences
#+tags: cobra garage

So, the garage has yet again a new floor. The top one of the images
below is from the current situation, the one below it is from the
first attempt (already 2 years ago!). Spot the differences&#8230;

Let's hope this time the cracks will not appear. Having to clear out
the garage, store everything somewhere and put everything back is
definitely not my idea of a good time.

On the /cobra-building front/ it's a bit quiet due to lack of
parts, though I could do a few jobs on the chassis and suspension I
guess, but for many of them I want to be able to take measurements of
the engine, gearbox and other stuff before I do them.

I have been assured that the parts will be available for collection
next week, so it should not be that long before I can get cracking at
a slightly higher pace.
