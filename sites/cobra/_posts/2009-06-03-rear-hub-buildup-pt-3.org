#+title: Rear hub buildup pt. 3
#+tags: cobra donor-parts rear-suspension

With all parts galvanized, a next step can be taken in building up the
rear hubs. I can't complete the rear hubs completely because a spacer
thickness needs to be determined to get the necessary endfloat in the
hubs. Starting by putting the rear hub in a vice...

â€¦and greasing up the bearing.

After placing the housing on top of the bearing and filling the cavity
with lots of grease, the inner bearing can be driven in, but not
completely. Formally, a jaguar specific tool (J15 or something like
that) should be used to put pressure on the bearing. This tools
contains a machined edge with a specific height (0.152" I think) which
makes sure the bearing is not driven in completely. By leaving a
little bit of room a (large) endfloat can be measured and from there
the necessary spacer thickness can be calculated. Not having this tool
I ordered the thickest spacer (0.148") for an alternative procedure.

{%gmg shadowed 307 %}
#+END_HTML

With this spacer on top of the inner bearing the whole hub was put
under the press to drive in the bearing. When the spacer is flat with
the bearing the endfloat can be measured.

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 308 %}
#+END_HTML

In my case the endfloat was 0.016" The target endfloat is between
0.002" and 0.006", aiming at the average 0.004". So, instead of the
0.148" spacer I would need a 0.148" - 0.012" = 0.136" which is exactly
the size I took out of the donor part, so I can reuse that one.

This result was expected for one hub only though. One of the hubs [[/2008/04/crack-in-the-pot.html][had
to be replaced]] because of a crack. It is likely that this hub has
different dimensions and another size spacer will be needed. Doing the
same procedure for the other hub revealed that the 0.148" spacer would
lead to an endfloat of near zero ?!?

Hmm...

So, I would need a spacer with a minimum thickness of 0.150" (leading
to the minimal endfloat of 0.002") This spacer *used to* exist, but
apparently not anymore. Need to sleep on this one what to do here.
