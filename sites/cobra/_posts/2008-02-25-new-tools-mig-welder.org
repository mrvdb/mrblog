<p>I have been looking to buy a new welding machine for a while. Initially i had my mind set on a TIG machine, or one which could do both MIG and TIG. The lure of the very nice TIG welds got to me i guess.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/2670786544/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2670786544_93ec5a8e3e.jpg" class="flickr portrait" alt="" /></a><br /></p>
<p>A short talk with the guy at the excellent <a href="http://www.rustbuster.nl" title="Rustbuster tools supplies">Rustbuster</a> shop quickly convinced me that MIG was the better option for my skill level; beginner, not to mention my wallet. A good TIG machine costs the world. After trying a few welds in their training room I went for the Cebora Bravo 155 machine. This was one of the rare occasions where i spent less money than originally envisioned. I am going to attend some welding course when time permits.</p>
