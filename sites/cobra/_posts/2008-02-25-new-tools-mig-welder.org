#+title: New tools: MIG welder
#+tags: cobra tools

I have been looking to buy a new welding machine for a
while. Initially i had my mind set on a TIG machine, or one which
could do both MIG and TIG. The lure of the very nice TIG welds got to
me i guess.

A short talk with the guy at the excellent [[http://www.rustbuster.nl][Rustbuster]] shop quickly
convinced me that MIG was the better option for my skill level;
beginner, not to mention my wallet. A good TIG machine costs the
world. After trying a few welds in their training room I went for the
Cebora Bravo 155 machine. This was one of the rare occasions where i
spent less money than originally envisioned. I am going to attend some
welding course when time permits.
