<p>Success on the pivot shaft:</p>

<p>Some careful sawing and using a vice to hold the puller slowly released the last bits from the pivot shaft.<br /></p>

<p>All the donor parts are now disassembled, so the reconditioning of the diff is next. I ordered the gasket and a replacement pinion seal, let's hope that is all that is needed.</p>
