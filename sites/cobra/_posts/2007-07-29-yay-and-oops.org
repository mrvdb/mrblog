Success on the pivot shaft:

Some careful sawing and using a vice to hold the puller slowly
released the last bits from the pivot shaft.

Yay!

On the other hand, trying to pull the stub axle from its carrier broke

Oops! I then took the carrier to the local garage where their press
quickly persuaded the stub axle to come out. I must get me one of
those too!

All the donor parts are now disassembled, so the reconditioning of the
diff is next. I ordered the gasket and a replacement pinion seal,
let's hope that is all that is needed.
