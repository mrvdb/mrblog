I'm declaring the garage finished! While this is never the case, as
there is always room for improvement, the major work is complete.

Here's roughly how it looked before we started:


#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 395 %}
#+END_HTML

Here's the best comparison I could find for the outside
view. Apparently we did not take a picture once everything was done,
odd.

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 397 %}
#+END_HTML


This shows much better what it was all about:

#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 397 %}
#+END_HTML
#+BEGIN_HTML
{%gmg shadowed 398 %}
#+END_HTML
