<p>I'm declaring the garage finished! While this is never the case, as there is always room for improvement, the major work is complete.</p>
<p>Here's roughly how it looked before we started:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #0000EE"><span style="color: #333333"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/2669984941/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/2669984941_a7bbc7dc05.jpg" class="flickr" alt="" /></a></span><br /></span></p>
<p>Here's the best comparison I could find for the outside view. Apparently we did not take a picture once everything was done, odd.</p>

<p>This shows much better what it was all about:</p>
