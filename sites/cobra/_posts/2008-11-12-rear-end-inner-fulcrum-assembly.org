#+title: Rear end: inner fulcrum assembly
#+tags: cobra rear-suspension

To continue on the front-suspension I'll
have to wait till the oil seals have been soaked. So, back to the rear
end then. I decided to tackle the mass-washer effort of the lower
inner fulcrum. Every one of the four sides to do has a set of 4 rings
and some to keep in place. Here's the set, layed out.

Everything but the nuts at the end also needs greasing. In the end
it's just doing things in the proper sequence. Start off with one
side, grease everything up which needs to go on there and press the
shaft a little bit through.

With the help of a dummy shaft, I made
sure the fulcrum was aligned properly, so I could gently tap it
through the distance tube in the middle. The hardest part is then to
position the inner set of 4 rings. Everything is slippery due to the
grease and there's not much room. With some patience it's doable
though. Repeat on the other side and make sure the shaft has an equal
protrusion on either side.

The last step is to put the GD brackets
on. I was a bit nervous about this step, the holes in these brackets
are drilled very accurately and if they would not fit it could mean
that my shimming was incorrect and I would have to do that bit all
over again (and go through all the washer hell too). However, the fit
was perfect! Yay! Keeping my fingers crossed this translates into the
proper toe-in too later on!
