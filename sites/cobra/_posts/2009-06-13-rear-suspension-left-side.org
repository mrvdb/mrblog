The one completed hub begs to be assembled. There are a number of
steps involved to correctly complete this job. First is to create a
level working environment. This is somewhat easy for me, as the car
hoist I have is adjustable at the four corners. I already had the
chassis levelled out, so the only thing needed was to check and fine
tune it.


Next, I created a dummy shaft for the outer fulcrum, having a slightly
smaller width as the hub. This simplifies assembling the hub to the
wishbone considerably and makes sure the shims which are inside the
fulcrum stay properly positioned.

The "hubâ€”wishbone fit" was pretty much dead on. There are shims to
make sure the hub is centred and to prevent bending the ends of the
wishbone. I had bought a set of 8 or so but I could only fit (with
considerable effort) one shim of 3 or 8 thou (cant remember). Not sure
how critical this is.

Next up was setting up the lower wishbone having a 2" downward slope
over its length; presumably emulating the normal ride-height like
that. Fitting shims between the drive-shaft and the brake-disc makes
it easy to adjust the camber. The one-tenth of a degree negative
camber should do just fine for now. I bet I need to revisit this once
the car is completed and the proper ride-height is determined.

The big nut on the drive shaft needs to be torqued up (only to 75Nm
apparently, which seems small for such a big boy). Doing that is
somewhat awkward on just the hub, on the complete assembly however it
is basically just a matter of 'putting the thing on the handbrake' and
torque up the nut. Also the [[http://cobra.mrblog.nl/2009/06/rear-hub-buildup-pt-3.html][previously determined endfloat]] can be
checked again now, which I will do tomorrow.

For the 4 inner lock nuts I've have fitted
some temporary nuts for now; to be replaced with the metal-lock nuts
once the whole assembly is attached to the chassis.

So, for the other side, I still need the inner oil seal and a set of
shims to be able to complete it. They should arrive this week.
