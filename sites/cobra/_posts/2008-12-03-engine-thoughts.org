I want to take a number of preliminary decisions on the engine, so I
can move forward in that area.

Spent more or less the weekend reading up on the differences between
all the different models of LS engines and their architecture in
general. A while ago I bought a book on LS engines because frankly, I
dont know much about the LS engines.

Since I bought that book there have been some new LS engines, notably
the LS2 and LS3. At this moment the LS2 is the most interesting,
price-wise, when compared to a new LS1 or new LS3. I was also
considering buying second hand, but the price difference is not that
big and the uncertainty factor of what such an engine has been through
on one hand and the limitation of choice (at least in the netherlands
almost all second hand LS engines are LS1's) on the other, made me
focus on new engines.

Second, how much self building do i want to do? In theory, if I look
at my initial goals for this project, the answer would be 'all of
it'. However, that may not be the smartest thing to do. Building up
the engine from a bare block will take quite a bit of time (not a
problem, i'm not in a hurry). It will most likely be more expensive,
not only because all the parts separately are more expensive than a
prebuilt crate engine, but there's also a need to purchase some
special tools and other materials needed to build the engine. The
difference in price can be considerable. The first part of an engine
build; putting in the crankshaft and pistons seems to require some
special tools and expertise, after that it seems to get easier.

Now, where to get one? This turns out to be actually the first thing
to look into. There is no 'easy' way, as in walking to a supplier in
the netherlands, sit down for an afternoon to get things right and
place an order. Importing from either US or UK is an option, where the
UK route seems a bit easier, especially because GD itself is a
supplier of the LS engines. This part of the puzzle is ongoing.

So, to sum up, here's what I am looking for:
- LS2 engine, preferably short block, but open to crate engine deals
  ;-)
- if short block a supplier which can supply all the parts too;
- No ECU or loom needed (will use [[http://gdcars.com][GD]] and a [[http://www.omextechnology.co.uk/page8.html][OMEX]] stuff for that);
- a detailed technical manual on how to build up such a beast.
