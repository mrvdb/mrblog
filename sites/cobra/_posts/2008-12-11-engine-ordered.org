<p>After some more phoning and mailing back and forth, I parted with the money for a new LS2 crate engine. Now the waiting game begins. Hopefully sometime soon I should be able to collect it.</p>
<p>In the end I went for the complete engine package instead of building from bare or short-block. The deals you can get on crate engines these days are so good that building one from scratch is, at least money-wise, absolutely not interesting. I would have liked building one though. Oh well, it's not as if there are no other jobs to complete.<br /></p>
<p>There is no way this engine goes into the cold and damp garage for now, so the view from behind my desk should considerably improve when the engine arrives. :D</p>
