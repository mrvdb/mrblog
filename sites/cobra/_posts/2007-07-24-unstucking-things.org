<p>Almost done with disassembling all the donorparts, one wishbone still to be removed, the rest is all done and waiting in line to be <em>electrolysed</em>.</p>
<p>Along the way most time is consumed by things which are stuck, but need to be loosened. Yesterday i spent a whole day grinding a wishbone from its subframe because <em>tapping-it-out</em> was undoable. Here's another example, as of yet unsolved, of something which is stuck. Suggestions are welcome. I'm thinking of putting it into the oven or use a mini flame thrower on it.</p>

<p>Also had a quick look at the differential. Although it was said to be 100% in order, i'm hesitant not to check and recondition it. There's at least the pinion seal which is leaking and the paint isn't covering the whole diff. So, this will need some work.</p>
<p>The differential also seems to be the most logical place to start the actual build with, that is, the first part to prepare and finish before assembly starts.</p>
