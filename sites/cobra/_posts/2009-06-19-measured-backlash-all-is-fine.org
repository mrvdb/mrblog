Did some research on the allowed backlash and the general consensus
seems that a 2/3" to 1" backlash measured on the outer rim of the
brake disc is acceptable. (which seems very large to me actually)

I should have photographed a measuring tape next to the marks, but
it's way less than an inch, so I guess I'm in the clear.
