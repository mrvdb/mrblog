Did some research on the allowed backlash and the general consensus seems that a 2/3" to 1" backlash measured on the outer rim of the brake disc is acceptable. (which seems very large to me actually)

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96151162@N00/3641713600" title="View 'Measured backlash' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3570/3641713600_0d8b4ebeb4.jpg" class="flickr" /></a></p>

I should have photographed a measuring tape next to the marks, but it's way less than an inch, so I guess I'm in the clear.
