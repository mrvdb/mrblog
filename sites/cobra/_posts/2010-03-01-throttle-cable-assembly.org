The throttle setup, converted from the electronic standard one to a
cable operated setup, touched slightly on the block.

A careful couple of minutes of filing made sure it ran freely. On the
outrun to the back of the engine of the cable I mounted two rubber
P-clips to guide the cable across.

I think I’ll put some shields on top of the valve covers later on,
which can then neatly hide the cable from sight.

As said earlier, I would rather have the electronic throttle
valve, but for safety reasons that’s not allowed.
