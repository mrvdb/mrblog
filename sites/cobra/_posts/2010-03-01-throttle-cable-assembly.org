 <p>The throttle setup, converted from the electronic standard one to
   a cable operated setup, touched slightly on the block.

<p> A careful couple of minutes of filing made sure it ran freely. On
  the outrun to the back of the engine of the cable I mounted two
  rubber P-clips to guide the cable across.

<p> I think I’ll put some shields on top of the valve covers later on,
  which can then neatly hide the cable from sight.

<p> As said earlier, I would rather have the electronic throttle
  valve, but for safety reasons that’s not allowed.
