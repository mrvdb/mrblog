#+title: About this site

The site /MrBlog.nl/ is my personal entry point to what I do on the
web. It is mostly for myself to experiment with things while
pretending to be a blog.

To build the site I have borrowed a number of tools and resources from
others. I try to keep a complete list of them complete with links back
to them:

- blog system is [[http://jekyllrb.com][jekyll]];
- theme is a built with [[http://getbootstrap.com][bootstrap]] components;
- all files are edited with the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] editor;
- Comment system: [[http://disqus.com][Disqus]];
- I use [[http://git-scm.com][git]] to publish the blog to my server and to a repository on
  [[https://github.com/mrvdb/mrblog][github]];
- Content is mostly written in [[http://orgmode.org][orgmode]] or [[http://darinfireball.net/projects/markdown/][markdown]];
- Some of the images are hosted on [[http://flickr.com][flickr]];
- the [[http://entypo.com][Entypo]] icons are used;
- Orgmode files are converted using [[https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby][org-ruby]] with the help of a little
  [[https://gist.github.com/abhiyerra/7377603][org-converter]];
- [[https://github.com/judofyr/ruby-oembed][ruby-oembed]] is used for automatic embedding of media with the help
  of an [[https://gist.github.com/vanto/1455726][oembed liquid tag]];
- A locally generated json file is used to implement search;
  functionality. A modified version of [[https://github.com/mathaywarduk/jekyll-search][jekyll-search]] is used;
- Bootstrap is dependent on the [[http://jquery.com][jquery]] library, but I use it directly
  too for the live statusnet feed and the search function;
- the site is served with [[http://nginx.org][nginx]] on a machine running [[http://debian.org][Debian]] GNU/Linux;
- for the git log listing (see below), I adapted the [[https://gist.github.com/alx/730347][gitactivity]] tag
  plugin by Alexandre Girard.

If you feel that credit for one of your programs should be in this
list, let me know.

{% assign sorted_tags = site.tags | sort %}
{% assign tagstring = '' %}

I keep an [[issues.html][issue list]] for this site on a separate page.
