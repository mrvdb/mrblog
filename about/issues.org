#+TITLE: Issue list for this site
#+LAYOUT: page
#+OPTIONS: todo:t

Because everything is orgmode now, I might as well keep an issue list
for the site and publish it. Managing todo items is pretty well
covered in org-mode ;-)

**** DONE Published property is not working
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-22 zo 12:38]
     :END:
**** DONE The automatic excerpt is not working
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-22 zo 17:22]
     :END:
**** TODO Move comment system to something static
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 14:58]
     :END:
     To keep with the spirit of a Jekyll site, comments should really be
     static as well.
**** TODO Create a better way for handling remote images
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:23]
     :END:
     Similar to the gmg plugin, but more generic. Goal is to have a
     quick way to insert a properly styled image, based on a class or keyword.
**** TODO UTF-encoding is not working properly
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:24]
     :END:
     See for example
     [[https://mrblog.nl/2009/09/18/a-weeks-worth-of-claws-mail-on-osx.html]]

     The odd thing is that locally it renders fine, so it's probably a
     nginx setting?
**** TODO Make pages searchable
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:27]
     :END:
     I think only posts are now handled by the search plugin
**** TODO Make collections searchable
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:28]
     :END:
**** TODO Adapt gmg preset to fetch small image and load large with lytebox
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 16:12]
     :END:
**** TODO Find some sort of automated link checker
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 16:13]
     :END:
**** TODO Search result page should have title and an excerpt, but not more
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 17:32]
     :END:
**** TODO Improve rendering of TODO list
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-21 za 12:25]
     :END:
