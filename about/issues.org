#+TITLE: Issue list for this site
#+LAYOUT: page
#+OPTIONS: todo:t

Because everything is orgmode now, I might as well keep an issue list
for the site and publish it. Managing todo items is pretty well
covered in org-mode ;-)

**** DONE Published property is not working
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-22 zo 12:38]
     :END:
**** DONE The automatic excerpt is not working
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-22 zo 17:22]
     :END:
**** DONE UTF-encoding is not working properly								 :fix:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:24]
     :END:
     See for example
     [[https://mrblog.nl/2009/09/18/a-weeks-worth-of-claws-mail-on-osx.html]]

     The odd thing is that locally it renders fine, so it's probably a
     nginx setting?
**** TODO Move comment system to something static						       :build:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 14:58]
     :END:
     To keep with the spirit of a Jekyll site, comments should really be
     static as well.
**** TODO Create a better way for handling remote images					       :build:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:23]
     :END:
     Similar to the gmg plugin, but more generic. Goal is to have a
     quick way to insert a properly styled image, based on a class or keyword.
**** TODO Make pages searchable										 :fix:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:27]
     :END:
     I think only posts are now handled by the search plugin
**** TODO Make collections searchable									 :fix:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-19 do 15:28]
     :END:
**** TODO Adapt gmg preset to fetch small image and load large with lytebox			     :improve:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 16:12]
     :END:
**** TODO Find some sort of automated link checker						       :build:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 16:13]
     :END:
**** TODO Improve rendering of TODO list							     :improve:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-21 za 12:25]
     :END:
**** TODO Look at jekyll-staging gem								       :check:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-22 zo 19:13]
     :END:
**** TODO Configure multiple formats for mrblog.nl blog postings				       :build:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-18 wo 09:58]
     :END:
     Now all source is valid org-mode we have a plethora of nice options:
     - deliver original source format (org-mode)
     - pdf format        (for printing)
     - openoffice format (for additional editing)
     - plain text format (for email)

In the jekyll spirit, this should really all be generated statically
and published in the same way as org->html For the latter we use
org-ruby.

**** TODO Convert everything to html5
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2015-03-26 do 18:51]
     :END:
