title: About this site
---

The site *MrBlog.nl* is my personal entry point to what I do on the
web. It is mostly for myself to experiment with things while
pretending to be a blog.

To build the site I have borrowed a number of tools and resources from
others. I try to keep a complete list of them complete with links back
to them:

* blog system is [jekyll][];
* theme is a modified [72 Class theme][class72] by Alan Who;
* some images came from the [iNove theme][inove] by NeoEase;
* Programs used for posting content: Emacs, [orgmode][], [jekyll][];
* Comment system: [Disqus][];
* Some parts of the theme came from the [octopress][] theme;
* I use [git][] to publish the blog to my server;
* Content is mostly written in [orgmode][] or [markdown][].
* Some of the images are hosted on [flickr][];
* the [Entypo][] icons are used;

If you feel that credit for one of your programs should be in this list, let me know.
