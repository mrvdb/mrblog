#+COMMENT -*- mode:org -*-

This directory contains the files needed for the program jekyll to
produce a website, in this case my personal blog at http://mrblog.nl
The content of the site is taken from the '_posts' and '_pages' folders.

The content can be any format that jekyll supports, which includes at
least markdown and html.

By default, anything  in this folder is copied to the website by
jekyll unless:

- the folder is special (starts with '_')
- it is excluded through the jekyl configuration

The files in this folder and in this folder and below alone should be
enough to generate the complete site by a =jekyll build= run, because
that is exactly what happens by pushing this folder to its git remote.

The content itself however may find its origin in other places,
typically an org-mode document or outline subtree; that is perfectly
fine. As long as a supported jekyll format ends up in this folder, the
site can be generated.

* Folders
  - _data :: a yaml file objects.yml in this directory can be accessed
             with site.data.objects
  - _includes :: templating snippets to be included in multiple places
  - _layouts :: layout templates
  - _pages ::  pages source directory
  - _plugins :: (ruby) plugins, these are called during build

  - error :: error documents
  - feed :: feeds templates
  - files :: downloads to be copied to the site (move to assets?)
