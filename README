#+COMMENT -*- mode:org -*-

This directory contains the files needed for the program jekyll to
produce a website. The content of the site is taken from the '_posts'
and '_pages' folders.

The content can be any format that jekyll supports, which includes at
least markdown and html.

By default, anything  in this folder is copied to the website by
jekyll unless:

- the folder is special (starts with '_')
- it is excluded through the jekyl configuration

The files in this folder and in this folder and below alone should be
enough to generate the complete site by a =jekyll build= run, because
that is exactly what happens by pushing this folder to its git remote.

The content itself however may find its origin in other places,
typically an org-mode document or outline subtree; that is perfectly
fine. As long as a supported jekyll format ends up in this folder, the
site can be generated.
