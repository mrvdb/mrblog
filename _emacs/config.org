#+title: Orgmode configuration
#+layout: orgmode


This page is a rendering of my Emacs configuration. I use =org-babel= to
specify my configuration in an orgmode file that dynamically gets
converted, or tangled as it is called, to an =elisp= file loaded during
emacs startup.

As my =jekyll= setup is capable of rendering =org-mode= syntax files
directly I have put this original config file in place and have jekyll
produce a rendering of it. The original of this file lives on github
at the following location:
