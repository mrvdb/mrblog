 <p>Mrblog.nl is my personal entry point to what I do on the web.  </p> <p> As always, I have borrowed a lot from people before me, I'll try to give them credit here: </p> <ul> <li>blog system is <a href="http://mu.wordpress.org">Wordpress-Âµ</a>; </li> <li>theme is a modified <a href="http://alanwho.com/wordpress/72class/">72 Class theme</a>; </li> <li>some image are from the <a href="http://www.neoease.com/themes/">iNove theme</a>; </li> <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nospamnx/">NoSpamNX</a> keep most, if not all, spame out of my face; </li> <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify">Google code prettify</a> tries to syntax highlight code sections; </li> <li>Programs used for posting: <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit">MarsEdit</a>, <a href="http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">org2blog</a> </li> <li>when posts are written in markdown, the <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/TextControl">TextControl plugin</a> renders   it to html on the site; </li> <li>most of the plugins have been modified by me te better suit my   workflow (or make them work in the first place) </li> </ul>   <p> If you feel that credit for one of your programs should be in the list, let me know. </p>
