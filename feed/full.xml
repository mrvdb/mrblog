    This comment has a function. Due to braindead browser designers we
    are forced to fill up the first 512 bytes of this file without
    starting the feed tag.
    This tricks the browser sniffer; not applying its own styling (in
    the case of firefox) or not applying any styling at all (like in
    the case of chrome).
    By the time we have filled the 512 bytes the sniffer gives up and
    our file is parsed according to standards, as it should have been
    from the beginning.
