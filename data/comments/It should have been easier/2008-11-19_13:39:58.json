  "message": "<p>Hi Marcel,</p><p>The UJ caps are not as tight a fit as you might think - if you no not press exactly concentric then they can easilly jam. It is easy enough to tap them in with a bearing drift and a hammer. Also you don't want to drive them too far as this will make the UJ stiff. When you have got them all in and fitted the clips you will need to knock the caps back against the clips to free up the UJ. There is some info on how to do this in the Haynes Manual - if you havn't got a manual I can scan the page for you.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Simon.</p>",
