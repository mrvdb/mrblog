  "message": "<p>A couple of quick calls sorted out both issues. For the wishbone shaft, I apparently got delivered a JLM 11858  and a JLM 11859, which are identical, except for the length. The shorter one (the 59-er) is the one I need. While I had Martijn from Kolvenbach on the phone I ordered a couple of other parts I needed. He had everything in stock :D</p><p>For the upper wishbone I've decided to force fit it, after talking to Mischa from speedon. There's not much else we can do I guess, other than adapting the chassis plate.</p>",
