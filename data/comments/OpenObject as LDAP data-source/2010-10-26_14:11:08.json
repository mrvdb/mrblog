  "message": "<p>The table ldap_organizational unit is indeed not mentioned, it's a simple table which just holds the names of organization units (just one, in my case), here's the definition of our OpenERP database:<br><code><br>CREATE TABLE ldap_organizationalunit<br>(<br>  id serial NOT NULL,<br>  \"name\" character(255),<br>  CONSTRAINT \"ldap_organizationalUnit_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY (id)<br>)<br></code></p><p>The errors about expect_return are likely to be specific to your install, as they get generated by the definition of the view 'ldap_inetorgperson' which references the standard OpenERP table 'res_partner_address'. That table may have different constraints in your install depending on what OpenERP modules you have installed. By the looks of it, there is a column expect_return which wants to have a value.</p>",
