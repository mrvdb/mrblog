While looking for a solution to a LaTeX path search problem i ran into this:

#+BEGIN_HTML
<div class="attribution">
  <blockquote cite="http://hans.fugal.net/blog/2009/03/12/microwave-duty-cycle#comments">
    <p>As you may know, when you change the power setting on most microwaves, it doesnâ€™t change the power output of the magnetron. It changes the duty cycle, i.e. when the magnetron is on and when it is off.</p>
  </blockquote>

  </cite>
</div>
#+END_HTML

He's a brave soul, I did this years ago too, but was afraid to admit (let alone publish it).
(Oh and I also found the solution to my LaTeX search problem there)
