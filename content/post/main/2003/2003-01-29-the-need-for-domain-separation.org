#+title: The need for domain separation
#+tags[]: xaraya

In general, the temptation to bring the templating language close
to the programming domain is high. It creates a possibility to do all
things which the programming language can do as well, often powerfull
and most of the time dangerous.


In BL there is some PHP syntax hidden in the tags (for example the
evaluation of conditions in if and while constructs).

Here's a good example why the domain of the blocklayout templating
system and the programming language in which it was implemented should
be separated.

Because the domain of blocklayout and PHP are so tight together
now, this is just one example of what can happen.
