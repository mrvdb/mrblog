#+title: blogging through email, continued
#+tags[]: integration

Worked a bit on the blog by email stuff. Sanitized the script a
bit. The posting should now be a bit more clean as the backend now
only includes stuff between the body tags of the received
html. Nowhere near rock-solid, but useable nevertheless.


Just for the technically inclined, this is the regexp used to extract
the blog entry from the html:

#+BEGIN_SRC
!<body[^>]*>(.*?)</body>!
#+END_SRC

Next step, getting some regular expression which makes sense to
extract excerpt and extended entry (if any) out of there. Thinking
about using

=----------------------------------------------------------------------=

as a separator; it just looks natural when composing the entry. Dunno.
