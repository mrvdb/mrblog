#+title: Jekyll support in emacs
#+tags[]: emacs
#+draft: true

*** Making the process effective
When writing articles, the activities basically consist of this boring
list:
1. Start a new file (based on a template)
2. Jot down some points which I want to write about, make sure the
   notes for myself get a =:noexport:= tag in orgmode;
3. Fill in layout type (always post)
4. Define some tags and other frontmatter material
5. Start writing
6. Save the file in the =_drafts= folder, give some thought about the filename
7. Commit it to the local git repository
8. When finished, move it to _posts, rename to something Jekyll wants
   (Prefix with: 'yyyy-mm-dd-').
9. Final checks and commit
10. Git push
11. - 35. Correct silly mistakes.

To cover these boring bits, a quick search on '/jekyll mode emacs/' shows
that others have done some work already:
- [[https://github.com/diasjorge/jekyll.el][Emacs support for jekyll]] : support functions for working with
     jekyll blog files.
- [[https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde][Hyde]] : major mode with front-end and git-support;
- [[https://github.com/cinsk/jekyll-org][Jekyll with Emacs Org-mode]] : skeleton setup of a jekyll directory
  with org-mode stuff preconfigured.

The last assumes the conversion is done from within org-mode so that
setup does not fit with what I have chosen to do. The first link is
available as the =jekyll-el= package, so I'm using that as my starting
point.
