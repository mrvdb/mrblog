#+title: Little bit of progress
#+tags[]: cobra brakes engine

Having a rolling chassis is nice, but having it rolling of the hoist
is another thing (not that this has happened yet). So, a working
handbrake seemed like a logical thing to do next. The original
handbrake end-bracket was to small for the supplied handbrake
cable. Adjusting it (by cutting a slot in it) did not seem a good
idea, as it would create a very small contact area for the bit at the
end of the cable.

In one of the drawers at [speedon](http://speedon.nl) Mischa found
something that could fit, and with a bit of effort, it indeed did.

The ECU has arrived too with a nice semi-assembled harness. Now I need
a handful of connectors and I should then be able to construct a
complete harnes and finish that part.
