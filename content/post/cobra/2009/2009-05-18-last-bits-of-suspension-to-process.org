#+title: Last bits of suspension to process
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts tools

The rear hubs have been waiting for 2 parts to be galvanised; the
water throwers. I bought these new as the originals were very pitted
and dented.

It costs something like â‚¬ 70,- to galvanise a box of parts. It does
not matter if that box has 2 bits or is cramped full. So, I've been
gathering things to fill the box with, but kind of struggled to get a
reasonably filled box. As I do want to finish the rear end of the
suspension soonish, the box was delivered to [[http://www.galvin.nl][Galvin]] to process. It
should be back here within 2 or 3 weeks or so.

Not sure how I am going to fit the throwers onto the hub
though. There is a small edge on the hubs over which the throwers
should be 'clicked'. Obviously I do not want to damage the throwers so
I'll either need to find a way to equalize the pressure over the
circumference or heat it up so it sort of drops over it
automatically. The edge seems to be smaller at the bottom than at the
top, so heating it seems a plausible way to go.

Once I get them back, I'll give that a try first.
