#+title: Rear hub buildup start and grease
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts tools

While waiting on the return of all the suspension components from
the galvanizer, there is not much to do. One thing is to prepare the
rear hubs for buildup.


I started to put in the bearing tracks. The fulcrum ones are
relatively easy.

The innner and outer bearing track is a different story though. Even
with the proper bearing drifts it takes quite a bit of hammering to
drive them home. After having done two, or rather one and a half i
phoned the local garage with the question if i could use their
press. That made it a lot easier! It did hurt a bit too see my hubs
getting dirty again though.

Also did a bit of reading to choose a grease. I ended up with [[http://www.kroon-oil.com/en/products/catalogue/seg_aut/krgr/402/automotive/kroon-oil-greases/high-grade-grease-ht-q9][Kroon
Oil Q9]] It had the words 'high grade' and 'automotive' on it, came with
a free grease gun, which looks a whole lot easier than my current
one....
