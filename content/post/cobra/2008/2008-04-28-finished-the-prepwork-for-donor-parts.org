#+title: Finished the prepwork for donor parts
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts tools

Spent the better parts of two days with my hands in the blasting
cabinet, peeking through a window which doesn't reveal a whole lot of
what is inside, due to the dust.

After a while I fabricated a suction device from an old vacuum
cleaner. That helped a lot, until the vacuum cleaner decided to short
out and smoke a bit.

This morning I gathered all the parts and delivered them to
[[http://www.galvin.nl][Galvin]] where I had the hand brake parts treated too. This time
the parts will be yellow-passivated, because that will provide a
better profile for coatings than the blue passivation. Got some
compliments of the guy at the factory, he said the parts he usually
got to treat looked /a bit different/
