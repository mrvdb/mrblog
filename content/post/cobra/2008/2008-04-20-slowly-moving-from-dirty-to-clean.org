The amount of dirty parts is shrinking considerably now. Especially
after blasting the parts that are 'ready for painting' look amazing.

It makes the parts almost look like there is a paint finish on them.

I also got my hands on a broken bench drill. It's a new machine but
the motor does not start well. Bit of a gamble, but it sounds like the
startup capacitor is either the wrong size or broken. It's too big for
my multimeter so i can not be sure if it is Ok or not.

Opening up the motor itself revealed a loose wire?!? Seconds before
the motor ran smooth, so i must have torn it loose on opening up the
motor. Other than that, the motor looked fine. I also noticed the
motor got quite hot when trying to get it to run, but i'm hoping that
is the abnormal load on the secondary coil during the testing. If I
can get this fixed by a capacitor replacement, i got a really good
deal! If not, i got a lousy one.
