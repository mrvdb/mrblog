#+title: Taking a bath.
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts

The donor parts reconditioning is typically the dirty phase of
building a kit car (unless you buy the parts reconditioned, but
where's the fun in that?). Removing all the crap from the rusty bits
isn't the most enjoyable part if you do it 'the classic way'. Simon
called it 'therapeutic' if i remember correctly. I'm gonna try another
therapy; bubble watching.


Someone pointed out [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis][electrolysis]] to me recently as an alternative and
that brought back some memories from school chemistry class. So, I
quickly constructed a test electrolysis bath from some old steel pins
donated to me by the [[http://www.bouwbedrijfvdzande.nl][contractor]] doing the garage, some rings to hold
these pins attached to the bath, an old ATX power supply, water and a
bag of washing soda. It looks something like this:

(If you are wondering about the CD player: it acts as a shunt so
the power supply actually keeps running, instead of stopping after 2
seconds, thinking there is nothing attached to it; i'll probably
replace this with a battery charger if i can find an old one.)

Fill up the tub with water, put in the soda, attach the +12V lead
to the steel pins at the outside and the other end to the bit we're
trying to de-rust. Then, flip the switch, sit back and wait.

Here's the before picture of my testpiece as removed from the front
axle:

I'm gonna leave this for the night and see what we have in the morning.
