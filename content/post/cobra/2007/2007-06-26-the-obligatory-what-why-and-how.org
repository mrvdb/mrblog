#+title: The obligatory what, why and how...
#+tags[]: cobra info

Building your own car has a certain lure to it. Not only the car
enthusiast, but almost everyone without exception, when told about my
plans, reacted with something similar to '/cool/!'


*What?*

So, what are these plans? In short, building me one of these:

What you see there is an /AC Cobra Replica/, [[http://www.gdcars.com][Gardner Douglas]] style. This
car is a replica of a 60's sports car originally manufactured by the
British '/AC Cars/', but made famous when [[http://www.carrollshelby.com][Carroll Shelby]] got his hands
on it to combine it with an American V8 Engine.

The first phase to building a car apparently is to spend countless
hours browsing the internet to get a grip on costs, supplier info and
the differences of all the offerings. Especially in the beginning of
this process, it is easy to lose whole weekends just doing that.

Two things stood out in this search process as being more important
than any supplier info:
  1. talking to people who have already built one;
  2. reading the *[[http://str-427-cobra.blogspot.com][excellent]]* build logs of other people who are
     building.

So, part of the plan is to document it, inspired by Simon's
excellent blog I linked to above. The journal will be mostly for
myself, but if it can please others like Simon's site helped me, that
will be very good.

*Why?*

I am not one of those car builders having a long outstanding wish
to build a Cobra kit car, although the thought has been on my mind on
and off for a couple of years. I am the owner of a small software
company and my daily work mostly consists of sitting behind a computer
screen, either communicating or programming. While I love the job, it
lacks a component which makes my body ache, dirty and smell bad; this
project will fill those gaps nicely.

Another part is just the curiosity if I can do this. It is a project
of reasonable complexity with a certain element of (financial) risk
attached to it. I guess if I just wanted to have a nice car, buying
one far outsmarts building one.

Luckily there's no real obligation to be rational on all of this,
since many elements of it are not. Having fun just doing it is
enough.

*How?*

We are in the fortunate situation to be living in a rural area
where our home and my office are combined. Behind these is a
reasonably big garage. It isn't in a very good shape, in terms of
weather protection, so part of the project is to rebuild part of the
garage, making it suitable to build the car. Part of the journal will
be filled with the activity on rebuilding the garage.

Anyways, enjoy!
