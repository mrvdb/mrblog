#+title: Slow days
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts

Steadily working on the donor parts, but days are a bit slow
lately. Finishing the details of the garage takes its time as
well. After treating the first donor parts, I'm not completely
satisfied with the finish that por15 plus the chassiscoat leaves.


The por15 itself is very nice, glossy and very smooth, so that's nice,
but the chassis coat ruins the bit by leaving stripes and not
smoothing out. Have to think about how to go about that. The first
thing is to add a bit of solvent to the chassis coat to make it smooth
out a bit better.

Next to that, inspecting the donor parts in detail reveals some
things which need some attention. The parts are mostly in good
condition, but obviously show their age and use.

One of the parts showed a worn (broken ?) inner wall. The other shaft
[[/2007/07/first-day-first-problems.html][had problems too]] but those I managed to repair to satisfaction. This
one will have to be replaced.
