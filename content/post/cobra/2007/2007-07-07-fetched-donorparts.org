#+title: Fetched donorparts
#+tags[]: cobra donor-parts

Drove up to John Kox from [[http://www.daxbenelux.com][Dax Benelux]] today to fetch two jaguar axles
and a differential. The diff looked pretty good as is, as it has been
in a Cobra until recently. I saw a little leakage on the front seal,
so it needs reconditioning anyways.


The axles are horrid as usual, but i trust they will clean up
nicely when i'm done with them.

Man, these things are heavy.
