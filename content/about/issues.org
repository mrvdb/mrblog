#+TITLE: Issue list for mrblog.nl
#+LAYOUT: page
#+OPTIONS: todo:t
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO | DONE CANCELLED(@)


Because everything is orgmode now, I might as well keep an issue list for the site and publish
it. Managing todo items is pretty well covered in org-mode ;-)

#+COMMENT: Leave the indents of the headers as they are below
#+COMMENT: it affects rendering on site and I dont have a good way of doing this with css

     :END:

     Now all source is valid org-mode we have a plethora of nice options:
     - deliver original source format (org-mode)
     - pdf format        (for printing)
     - openoffice format (for additional editing)
     - plain text format (for email)
     - activitystreams for listings (connect to mastodon)

     +In the jekyll spirit, this should really all be generated statically and published in the same way as org->html For the latter we use org-ruby.+ Using hugo now

This will be a bit tricky, as the original git has two unfinished branches and quite a few of untracked files which should be tracked.

***** TODO assess generate vs webserver config
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-18 wo 17:24]
:END:
For example the aliases generate directories, which is a bit messy on the server side, but leaves stuff in control locally. //

Is ther anything special in the webserver config now? I recall there being some aliases and redirects.

- old /feed is now /index.xml
- /category is rewritten to /tag
- cors header is added

     Similar to the gmg plugin, but more generic. Goal is to have a

https://gohugo.io/tools/search/


https://gist.github.com/eddiewebb/735feb48f50f0ddd65ae5606a1cb41ae looks ok-ish


The basic method is the same, generate some data file to query with client side code. Typically a json file.
While this is fine for small sites, this doesn't scale very well, the json file gets loaded completely for every search. At some point a smarter solution is needed.

In terms of implementation, typically some template is constructed, which is then generated alongside the pages, uploaded so the client side code can access it.

fuse.js gets the most votes

The theme I am using is planning an implementation for search in their 2.0 version which may be fine to wait for.
****** TODO integrate existing comments
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-18 wo 17:21]
:END:

They are not on site right now. But I have json exports from the disqus days.

No need to do this directly, but I don want to save the data.

I like the idea of staticman although i do not want to rely on github for the comments, I think it is possible to self host, but this may be quite a bit of work. Probably postponing.

I also like the idea of having the comments on a social site, and not having them directly on the blog itself, but that has a few nicknacks as well. I haven't seen an implementation yet which I liked.

****** TODO When viewing a post, show related in the sidebar

:END:
****** TODO look at automatically minifying
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-19 do 11:14]
:END:
I think there is a section in the documentation about the hugo pipe which may be related to this? Ideally this should be an option in the staging/production environment to set
****** TODO After deploy: reorganize content files
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-19 do 11:24]
:END:
There are a couple of folders below content which shouldn't really be there. The files folder should be examined and most of the files should probably move to its relevant document / posting where the post is converted to a page bundle. The downside is that the filesystem will then be littered with all these files and it will be hard to optimize for them or move them to a CDN if needed.
****** TODO Extend the deployment script
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-18 wo 17:24]
:END:

hugo deploy does only supports some cloud services, so i just need some sort of script to rsync the whole shebang.

Options:

1. rsync script to sync .site dir

   This is basically what the old site did, manual action, no frills. Good way to start I guess.

2. Use ansible for deployment

   Another option is to use an ansible script which can do the rsync, but also help configure the webserver and other things that may help manage the deployment.

3. Post receive hook on server

   An alternative deploy option could be a post-receive hook on the server side, this means only git and editor is enough to publish content, instead of hugo/git/rsync

   The site would then run a script after each push, taking care of updating the site on the right location on the server. An extra pro is that the amount of content that needs to go over the connection is probably a lot less (although rsync should be fairly efficient in just transferring the differences to what has already been published)
***** DONE Find some sort of automated link checker                                 :build:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2015-03-20 vr 16:13]
:END:
For now, using muffet on the command line and manually correcting. What I want is semi-automated processing on publish where links are marked as dead by css for example

***** DONE Move this TODO in site
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-19 do 11:24]
:END:

There is an issue list, so merge it with that ( and provide a bit better styling for TODO items

     What should that be?


     * DONE replace #tags: with #tags[]: in org files

this can be automated

***** DONE codestyling is incomplete, some style are invisible
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:32]

This is caused by having '=' inline code in the orgmode format

***** DONE get the gpx component working in hugo, probably needs a plugin of some sort

:END:

***** DONE improve shadow of content images
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-17 di 13:56]
:END:

I want basically a shadown for pictures which are content of their own, but I dont want a shadow if the image is supporting the text flow, like in the bitcoin article.

This can probably be done along the way, but it should be very easy to include

Current situation:
- when just linking to an image file, the filename will be the caption and the image will have a shadow
- it makes sense to define some classes so the can just set that.
  - ns :: no shadow
  - fl :: float left
    fr :: float right
***** DONE do i want the toml, i think i prefer yaml

***** DONE configure the social icons
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:10]

- i basically want the url copy, mastodon
***** DONE get the social timeline plugin back on to the frontpage
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:31]
:END:

Why do I want this actually? It is not adding anything useful for the reader other than seeing what I am reading on my mastodon account.

***** DONE logo/siteicon etc
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:11]
:END:
***** DONE move over about page
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:27]
:END:

In the theme now, while it is a content page in my old site. I think hugo calls this a page bundle.

- added layout=page new template and adjustment for pages
-

What I want:
- [X] /about the content of the about page, not listed in rss or other stuff
- [X] /about/issues.html or /about/issues which shows the issues page

The first is easy, but I can't get the second one to work
***** DONE remove/disable the boilerplate content

:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:28]
:END:
***** DONE configure archetypes
:PROPERTIES:

This is just needed when using the cli interface, with hugo new?
***** DONE adjust social line to home line instead of my line?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-18 wo 12:51]
:END:
***** DONE make sure the taxonomy is configured properly
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-14 za 18:28]
:END:

We just need tags at first. Series sounds like something what would work if the subsite multisite idea does not work out, but for now, just tags is sufficient

***** DONE get katex locally?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-16 ma 10:46]
:END:

It is a function I do not use much, so I am postponing this for now.

***** DONE on the archive page some posts are double
:PROPERTIES:

Which was correct, the content files were double too, fixed now.
***** DONE /archive needs a link
